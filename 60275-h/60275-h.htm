<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I</span> entered the lace-world by the
grim door of war. For it was the
war-time work of the women of the
Brussels Lace Committee that opened the
way to me.</p>

<p>Long before the war, Queen Elizabeth
in Belgium, like Queen Margharita in
Italy, had sought means to protect the
lace worker, through centuries the victim
of an economic injustice, not to say crime,
and to rescue and develop an industry
threatened from many sides. In 1911 she
gave her royal encouragement to a group
of prominent Belgian women who organized
as “Amies de la Dentelle,” Friends
of Lace, and began a lace-saving campaign
by trying to remedy the deplorable
condition of most of the lace schools, the
defective teaching, long hours, and pitiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>pay. They could insist in the schools, as
they could not elsewhere, on the right to
inspect, to grant or refuse patronage.
They subsidized worthy institutions, and
advocated the establishment of a lace normal
school and of a special school of
design. Education they felt to be the
main road leading out of the prevailing
misery, and they were making progress
along this road, when suddenly the
Invader poured over their borders.</p>

<p>While other women hurried to open
refuges and hospitals and soup-kitchens,
a few of the Friends of Lace remembered
first the lace-makers; and by November
1914, had effected a war emergency organization,
known as the Brussels Lace
Committee, with Mrs. Whitlock as honorary
president. Unfortunately most of
the lace dealers failed to cooperate with
them, but they won the approval of the
powerful Belgian Comit&eacute; National, which,
with the Commission for Relief in Belgium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
carried on the relief of the occupied
territory throughout the war. And
with an initial gift of $25,000 from
America to be converted into lace, they
were able to start their work. It soon
came to be directed altogether by four
women; The Comtesse Elizabeth d’Oultremont,
Lady-in-Waiting to Queen
Elizabeth; the Vicomtesse de Beughem,
an American; Madame Josse Allard, and
Madame Kefer-Mali. At the same time
the aid and protection of workers on
filets and other commonly called “imitation”
laces, was assigned by the Comit&eacute;
National to another group of women, the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Union Patriotique des Femmes Belges</span>.”</p>

<p>The Brussels Lace Committee employed,
as trusted business director of
their offices, M. Collart, generously released
to them by the Allard Bank, and
as technical expert, Madame Sharlaecken,
before the war with the Compagnie des
Indes, one of the largest lace houses in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Belgium; and as the work developed,
an increasing number of designers and
aides necessary to a lace business were
added.</p>

<p>During the first few months the situation
seemed utterly hopeless; thread was
impossible to obtain; and even if the
thread were forthcoming, no one could
say who would buy the laces they might
encourage the women to make; the Germans
were cutting off successive sections
of the lace-making areas where they had
established sub-committees, and were forbidding
communication with them. And
yet these four women continued bravely
to create the foundations of a great lace
business&mdash;for an extraordinary commercial
organization grew from their efforts.</p>

<p>However, despite all their intelligence
and devotion, such a result would have
been impossible but for a hard-won diplomatic
victory. In early 1915 Mr. Hoover
forced an international agreement which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>permitted the C. R. B. to bring thread
for the Lace Committee into Belgium,
and to take out an equivalent weight in
lace, to be sold in the Allied countries
for the benefit of the workers. England
required a rigid control of the thread, and
that it be given only to establishments
open to inspection by the C. R. B. At
one time these thread shipments were
stopt&mdash;a period of cruel anxiety for
the women&mdash;but happily after a re-adjustment
they were continued. And once
these international guaranties were obtained,
the Belgian Comit&eacute; National was
able to arrange for the distribution of the
thread to the various, even remote, lace
centers, and for the return of the finished
laces to Brussels. They granted the
women a subsidy of $10,000 and insured
to each <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;re</i> the chance to make at
least three francs worth of lace a week&mdash;a
small minimum, to be sure, but every
one understood it might be increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>later, and that if each of the many thousands
of workers was to have an equal
opportunity, it could not in the beginning
be more. After this the Lace Committee
had at times as many as 45,000
women on its lists. The work in the
schools and out of them began to bear
fruit. The sweating system, and payment
in kind (in clothing and food) were
practically wiped out, and inspection and
control established. Everywhere the
standard of design and of execution was
raised; old patterns were restored and
improved, and by the end of the war
2,237 new designs had been added.</p>

<p>But this was not advance through open
country. There was constant danger that at
any moment the way might be completely
barred; at any time the guaranties covering
the thread importations might be
withdrawn. The Germans early originated
a “Lace Control” of their own, and
tried in every possible way to win over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>the Belgian workers, and to buy up all
the lace in the country. They accused the
Brussels Committee of being a political
and patriotic body existing chiefly to defeat
the occupying powers and the Flemish
activists. Then there were other
courage-testing difficulties. But despite
all obstacles and perils, the women persisted,
and continually the precious skeins
of thread, with their message of “Carry
On” were flung out from Brussels to the
farthermost corners of the land, binding
all together in a firm and beautiful web
of hope and confidence. For the enemy
was right in suspecting the Committee of
a purpose deeper than that of merely
trying to save women from the soup-line;
they carried on a patriotic work of highest
importance. To them I owe a personal
debt of gratitude, for they permitted
me to follow their devoted service
closely, and they opened the door for me
to a new world of beauty and interest.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p><h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Lace</span> is a tissue composed of mesh and
“flowers” (pattern), or either one
alone, produced with a needle and single
thread, or with several threads manipulated
by means of bobbins. It is the
product of a natural evolution from early
embroideries and weaving.</p>

<p>We possess no contemporaneous history
of the origins and development of
the lace art, partly, perhaps, because of
the tradition, strong among the initiated,
of hiding its secrets, and of the consequent
difficulty of an outsider to master
them, and partly because successive wars
and world cataclysms have interrupted
or destroyed its progress.</p>

<p>We have ample proof, however, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>lace in some form existed in remote antiquity,&mdash;in
early Egypt, in Persia, in
Bysance and Syria, where it was chiefly
made by slaves; the Greeks and Hebrews
speak of needle lace as known throughout
all time. It was not, in these oriental
countries, the delicate white mesh that
we call lace, which would have been most
unbecoming to dark skin, but included
richly colored passementeries and filets
and fringes, woven of gold and silver
thread, of dyed wool and cotton, and of
the coarse linen fiber of the Nile Valley.
It was usually of hieratic and symbolic
design, and sometimes sown with gems&mdash;all
capable of brilliantly enhancing the
beauty of the East. Egyptian ladies of
6,000 years ago trimmed their robes with
elaborate lengths of filet, and covered
their dead with it. In the Cinquantenaire
Museum at Brussels there is the photograph
of a remarkable little woven linen
bag, similar to one we might carry to-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>day,
which was found in the tomb of a
Priestess of Hathor, bearing the mark
of one of the earlier dynasties. Its mesh
is almost identical with that of our modern
Valenciennes, and it was undoubtedly
made with bobbins.</p>

<p>Between ancient and mediæval times,
the lace-gap is unbridged by written
record; we must gather what we can from
the archeologist and from the works of the
sculptor and painter. Occasionally we are
thrilled by such a discovery as that of M.
Bixio, who in excavating at Claterna, an
old Roman City near Bologna, came upon
a set of bone bobbins, lying in pairs, as we
employ them in lace-making to-day. But
interesting discoveries are rare, and the
body of our knowledge of lace history so
far is meager.</p>

<p>However, we are interested primarily,
not in the ancient origins of the two great
lace groups, nor in early passementeries
and filets and their processes, but in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>marvelous efflorescence of the lace art of
the Western Europe of the <abbr title="sixteenth">16th</abbr>, <abbr title="seventeenth">17th</abbr>
and <abbr title="eighteenth">18th</abbr> centuries, and in its still lovely
expression of to-day.</p>

<p>In mediæval painting, before the appearance
of linen and its use as trimming,
or as lingerie, I know of no picture showing
lace. Stuffs were stiff and heavy,
and ornamented with metal, or with gold
or silver thread. As they became more
supple, we find, as in the portrait of
Wenceslas of Luxemburg (about 1360)
decoration introduced in the clipped cloth
border of the collar and hood. This serrated
edge suggests the first simple Cluny
lace patterns that appeared later. Then
we see the first linen showing through
the slashed sleeve or above the corsage,&mdash;one
of many paintings illustrating this
development, is that of the Duke of
Cleves, by Memling (second half of the
<abbr title="fifteenth">15th</abbr> century). And shortly afterward
the first lace edgings appear, the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of our lace of the middle ages, of
its rebirth in Western Europe. The
search for these details of progress in the
paintings of European galleries is a fascinating
and rewarding game; a Belgian
friend of mine has spent many years at
it.</p>

<p>The flowering of the lace-art was part
of the great Renaissance (lagging behind,
to be sure, the major arts) and now was
no longer the work of slaves, but regarded
as an important, independent
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m&eacute;tier</i>, and happily it usually escaped
the despotism of the mediæval corporations.
Italy, probably through
her exploitation in the early part of the
<abbr title="fifteenth">15th</abbr> century of her Greek Colonies, was
its first western home, and Venice, the
center for the exquisite needle laces of
which our museums fortunately still preserve
specimens. While laces made with
the needle and single thread were flourishing
under the Doges, bobbin laces,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>twisted and braided with many threads,
were being made in Sicily and in other
sections of the country.</p>

<p>From Venice, the secrets of the art
traveled easily in several directions, and
probably about the close of the <abbr title="fifteenth">15th</abbr> century
by way of the thriving port of
Antwerp, to the industrious and beauty-loving
Flanders, where the seed fell on
most fertile soil. Flanders possest a
multitude of workers already skilled in an
allied art, that of weaving, and the necessary
lace material in her valley of the
Lys, the finest flax region of the world.
Valenciennes, Lille, Malines, Ghent,
Bruges, turned to lace-making with a
veritable passion; it spread throughout
wide districts of what are now Northern
France and Belgium.</p>

<p>During the <abbr title="sixteenth">16th</abbr> and <abbr title="seventeenth">17th</abbr> centuries,
the lace industry made phenomenal progress,
both extensively and intensively.
Holland and England sent continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>larger orders to Flanders. As cloths
grew finer and softer, and the mode of
wearing them more graceful, and as daintier
linens were increasingly employed,
lace became ever more filmy and exquisite.
A worker spent perhaps a whole
year on a single meter of Valenciennes,
one head-dress cost as much as 200,000
livres. Every lace had its time, its season.
During this epoch, needle laces
were supreme, as bobbin laces were to
be in the <abbr title="eighteenth">18th</abbr> century.</p>

<p>Under Louis <abbr title="14">XIV</abbr> lace reached its
climax of perfection and beauty. Colbert
imported lace-women from each center
where they had been conspicuously successful.
He encouraged the invention of
new designs and technique; he subsidized
schools in many cities, at Reims, Alen&ccedil;on,
Arras, Sedan, and he threatened with
the death penalty those who might attempt
to carry lace secrets beyond the
French borders,&mdash;in every way he sought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>to develop an art that should belong
peculiarly to France. Thus directed and
subsidized by the state, and nurtured and
stimulated by a beauty-seeking court,
whose love of luxury was still controlled
by taste and refinement, it is not surprizing
that this lace-period surpassed any
other known. It was true of the Court of
Louis <abbr title="14">XIV</abbr> as of that of Louis <abbr title="13">XIII</abbr> that
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">seigneur</i> was known by the number and
quality of his lace points; some of them
possest several hundred garnitures. Unfortunately
the workers did not profit by
this brilliant development,&mdash;they seem
from the beginning predestined to be the
victims of a social and economic slavery.</p>

<p>But there were already evidences of
an attempt to control a demand for luxury
that threatened disaster. With the
<abbr title="sixteenth">16th</abbr> century, heavy duties and excess
taxes were levied upon lace. An edict,
dated 1729, prohibited the wearing of it,
in the hope of checking over-extravagance
in dress.</p>

<p>After its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apog&eacute;e</i> under Louis <abbr title="14">XIV</abbr>,
lace-making was caught, along with the
other arts, in the tide of degeneracy. Its
designs were marked by fantasy and grotesqueness,
rather than by the delicacy
and beauty of the preceding period; tho
while it deteriorated in design, its technique
grew constantly finer and more
complicated, until, from the point of view
of the workmanship at least, it seemed
almost superhuman. But in the second
half of the <abbr title="eighteenth">18th</abbr> century, wearied of complications
and extravagance, people
amused themselves by a return to simplicity.
The Marquise de Pompadour
affected laces sown with simple “flowers,”
and Marie Antoinette went further in
preferring a pattern of scattered “points”
or peas. With this return to the primitive
in design, the technique of lace reverted
also. In many quarters, the sheer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>muslins of the Indias gained favor over
lace. Trade, already burdened with the
duties and imports that had grown up
around the extravagant laces, suffered
further from the sudden popularity of the
simple costume.</p>

<p>The death-blow of the industry in
France was to follow close on the heels
of this new fashion. Since lace had been
the particular pride of the aristocrat, the
Revolution made it a crime to appear in
it. In such one-time famous centers as
Valenciennes and Lille, the bobbins
ceased, tho the industry of that region
sought refuge farther west, in Bailleul,&mdash;in
Bailleul, dust and ashes to-day! Fortunately
in Belgium, lace-making generally
survived the crisis of the Revolution,
tho it has suffered from succeeding disastrous
influences.</p>

<p>At the opening of the <abbr title="nineteenth">19th</abbr> century and
under the Empire, taste was heavy, design
rigid and military, with nothing in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with true lace motifs. During the
opening years of 1800 the invention of
machine-made tulle, brought from England
to Calais, effected further sad
changes in the lace-world; scarfs, veils,
entire robes of tulle, ornamented with
applications of needle or bobbin-made details&mdash;often
palms and laurel wreaths&mdash;were
all the mode. People preferred these
to the exquisite lace jabots and flounces of
the preceding century. In 1833 cotton
thread began to be used instead of the
stronger linen of the best lace periods. The
delicate lace-art continued to suffer with
all the others under the general decadence
of the reign of Louis Philippe and the Second
Empire. Industrial and commercial
development was the note of the age; the
rich amused themselves in travel, in new
scenes and sports, rather than in fostering
the arts. In fact, during the thirty
years following the war of 1870, lace
seemed almost forgotten except in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
The number of workers in Belgium
fell from between 100 and 150,000, to
50,000 or less.</p>

<p>But before the world was plunged into
this last, most destructive of wars, there
had been signs of a renaissance in the
decorative arts. People had begun to
read and compare, and refine their taste.
The rulers of Italy and France and Belgium
were winning results in their attempts
to rescue, and to revive and develop
the lace-art, which had seemed
threatened with extinction. Then came
the war&mdash;and the devastation of entire
lace regions, like that of Bailleul in
France, and of Ypres in Belgium. It is
true that many of the refugee lace-women
have been employed and encouraged
during the four years, by certain
committees in France and free Belgium.
And in occupied Belgium, the unceasing
efforts of the Brussels Lace Committee
have borne rich fruit. Whether the higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>standards of lace design and technique,
and the improved condition of the lace
workers&mdash;better education, shorter hours,
higher pay&mdash;will be maintained under
post-war conditions is yet to be proved.
Over this difficult hour of reconstruction,
of transfer from war to what we fondly
call normal conditions, we can but hope
to carry the hard-won gains of the testing
period.</p>

<p>In this little book I make no attempt
to present a history of lace, or a detailed
analysis of its processes. I have wished
merely to set down in simple form a few
of my observations in the lace districts
of Belgium, as the war has left her. To
follow them one does not need even an
elementary knowledge of the important
lace forms, tho that is easily acquired.
For there are but two large groups; the
needle-lace group, and the bobbin-lace
group, between which we learn quickly to
distinguish. We can not prove the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>of their respective origins; as we know
them, they seem to have existed side by
side, as they do in the Belgium of to-day.
Sometimes one was more popular, sometimes
the other.</p>

<p>To place a piece of lace, we have first
but to ask the question, “Was it made
with a needle, and by looping and twisting
and weaving a single thread; or was
it made by braiding and twisting and
weaving several threads, by means of
bobbins and a round or a square cushion?”</p>

<p>In general, there is but one technique
for all needle laces, tho there is no
limit to the variety of stitches the needle
worker may employ. I have seen a scarf,
made during the war for Queen Elizabeth,
in which there were many hundred
different points. One comes soon to
recognize the important needle laces; the
exquisite French Alen&ccedil;ons and Argentins
of earlier days, with their meshes made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>with a buttonhole loop, and their flowers
stiffened with horsehair; the various
Venetian points,&mdash;Venise, Burano, and
Rose point; and the extremely popular
Brussels point, with its gauze mesh and
raised flowers. It is characteristic of
these needle laces, that the flowers are
thrown into relief, sometimes high, sometimes
scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>Bobbin laces may be made with a dozen
or with one hundred times as many
threads, according to the design and
width of the lace. They fall into two
sub-groups, the first including laces made
with uncut threads, in a single piece; the
second, those made detail by detail, in
which the threads are cut as each is finished,
the completed lace piece being made
by joining these separate parts. This
second method was not introduced until
the latter half of the <abbr title="seventeenth">17th</abbr> century.</p>

<p>In the first group, made with uncut
threads, are the early Clunys and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>common Torchons, Old Flanders, the
beautiful Valenciennes, Point de Paris,
Point de Lille, Malines and Binche, with
their delicate round, or square or hexagonal
meshes, from which the pattern
blossoms. Their flowers are flat, never
lifted in relief, tho a heavy outlining
thread often sets them off brilliantly
from the surrounding field.</p>

<p>The second bobbin group, in which the
final lace piece is composed of united details,
includes black and white Chantilly,
Blonde, popular with Spanish peoples,
Brussels Duchesse and Bruges Duchesse,
most frequently displayed in our American
shops, and the finer Rosaline, which
was in great demand when the war broke
out. This group of bobbin laces admits
a kind of relief.</p>

<p class="small">Showing collar ornamented with bobbin-made cluny</p>
</div>

<p>Some laces combine both needle and
bobbin points. In the lovely Point d’Angleterre,
increasingly difficult to obtain,
bobbin-made flowers are united by an
airy needle mesh. And the coarser Flanders
lace has the same composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p class="captioncenter">ANNE OF AUSTRIA BY VAN DYCK</p>
<p class="small">About 1635, cluny lace made with bobbins</p>
</div>

<p>There are, besides, the familiar and
often beautiful Applications, in which
either needle or bobbin-made flowers are
stitched, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appliqu&eacute;d</i> on machine-made
tulle, or, rarely, on a tulle made by hand.
And various mixed laces, fantasies and
embroidered tulles, as well as a whole
company of cheaper tissues called lace, but
which can not honestly claim the name,
are trying always to crowd the true lace
from the market.</p>

<p>Naturally, the technique of any given
kind of lace has undergone various transformations
through the centuries. The
Valenciennes mesh, for instance, first had
round spaces, while square ones became
more popular later. During a certain
period the introduction of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jours</span>, or open-work
effects, added an airy lightness to
many laces.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure recently of being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>with a friend of mine, the sister of the
Belgian Consul-General at New York,
Madame Kefer-Mali, who has devoted
twenty years to the study of lace, when
she first examined a lace collection lately
presented to the Cinquantenaire Museum.
With magnifying glass I followed from
case to case, as she placed each specimen
in its country and century, according to
its design, its mesh, the manner of directing
the threads, the relief of the flowers,
the various stitches or the kind of thread
employed. As I listened to her, it was
easy to appreciate why lace may become
an all-absorbing interest. Madame Kefer-Mali’s
love for the lace itself is now subordinate
to her passionate desire to secure
justice for the lace-worker. As she
takes a filmy length in her hand, her first
thought is of the talent and patience of
the girl or woman who made it, of the
eye-straining, meticulous labor it represents,
and of the pittance still paid her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>for her gift to the world of art. Madame
Kefer-Mali has already won something
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;re</i> and she will continue
to fight for more.</p>

<p>Tho there are lace sections in widely
scattered parts of Belgium, none (except
Turnhout) is so important as those of
the two Flanders. Western and Eastern
Flanders form an almost continuous and
unrivalled lace region, which breaks up
irregularly into districts, each celebrated
for a particular kind, or for several kinds
of lace. However, it would be impossible
to draw an accurate map illustrating
the Belgian lace situation, either from the
point of view of the varieties made and
their quality, or of the workers. It seems,
indeed, at times that lace was invented to
defeat the statistician, for he no sooner
reaches a conclusion than it proves inexact;
a factory rises near a certain river
and the lace women desert their cushions
to accept its better wages; in a village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>long devoted to Needle Point, young
girls discover that the bobbin-made
Clunys pay better, or they marry and
make no lace at all until their children
are partly grown; poor crops and resulting
misery may send others who have not
for some time been listed as workers back
to their cushions. For, since despite the
many schools and work-rooms, the great
majority of women still work at home,
lace-making is peculiarly sensitive to
every change in family and community
life. We may say, however, that despite
constantly shifting conditions, Western
Flanders forms a great bobbin-lace area,
unquestionably the most important in the
world to-day, while Eastern Flanders has
been for centuries and still is, famous for
its needle points.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, too, because of the miserable
lace-wage (in Belgium, before the
war, it averaged about a franc a day)
this industry has been regarded always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>as a supplementary occupation, on which
the family could not rely for its main
support, and which was not capable of
organization and amelioration as other
industries are. The slavery conditions
have undoubtedly been due chiefly to lack
of good schools and constructive lace
training, and to the system by which a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">facteur</i>, or first buyer, collects the laces,
to re-sell them to a <i>fabricant</i>, or dealer,
who in turn may sell them to a larger
fabricant&mdash;a system permitting any number
of intermediaries&mdash;and also to the
fact that the women, scattered as they
are throughout the agricultural regions,
have never protected themselves by forming
syndicates. The first step toward
emancipation has been taken; the new
teaching is under way. The fatal system
of the many intermediaries remains to be
dealt with&mdash;to be swept away. And it is
hoped that feeling the new power education
will give them, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span> will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>at last find ways either through unions
or by other means, of protecting themselves.</p>

<p>For the rest, fixt data are difficult to
obtain. The lace industry can not be captured
and subjected to cold analysis and
tabulation. It must be studied differently
from other industries that can be
localized. As in learning to know the
garden flowers of a country, one must go
from doorstep to doorstep, so if one
wishes to understand lace, one should
become familiar with its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</i>, the family
and community life from which it
springs. In a sense, then, these little
journeys to lace districts which are the
subjects of my chapters, may suggest
more about what lace really is than a
more technical and formidable volume.</p>

<small><i>Lace Children of the North</i></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Lace</span> is the flower of Belgium; the
white blossom that springs from the
teeming plains of the Flanders, from
the agricultural districts, and from the
mournful Campine of the North. During
the long and solitary winters, when
work in the fields is impossible, thousands
of women and girls and little children
turn to their lace cushions, and dreary
rooms are enlivened by the music of the
flying bobbins. If the lace is Needle Point,
and lacks the accompanying click-clack of
the shifting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fuseaux</i>, it nevertheless gives
purpose and value to the otherwise almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
unsupportable winter days. However,
despite the time that must be subtracted
for weeding, for gathering the all-important
potato crop, and for other
farm duties, summer with its bright light
and long day, is the true lace season; it
is only then that some of the finest varieties
can be executed. Coarser pieces must
be substituted for the dull, eye-straining
days.</p>

<p>To be sure, some lace-making is still
carried on in certain cities, but very little.
This delicate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m&eacute;tier</i> can not successfully
combat the influences of the social and
industrial groupings of the larger centers;
the living wage, the shorter hours,
the distractions of cin&eacute;ma and caf&eacute;. The
cities remain the logical centers for the
normal and training-schools, for assembling,
and display, and sale; but the age-old
patience of the lace-maker is born of
a certain ignorance and isolation. This
does not mean that the industry may not
persist still on the fringes of some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>larger cities, or flourish in nearby villages&mdash;it
does; and in three conspicuous
instances, until the war, it remained the
dominating activity of a city. Bruges,
Ypres, and Turnhout, could truly be
called “lace cities.” Now there are but
two; for Ypres, the pearl of Flanders, is
gone.</p>

<p>Turnhout, a town of 24,000 inhabitants,
in the Northern Campine district,
is not only a “lace city,” counting 6,000
workers, but if one considers its long list
of excellent lace-schools, the fine varieties
made there, and the quality of the workmanship,
it appears sufficiently important
to challenge the leadership of Bruges.
However, Turnhout stands practically
alone in the north, while Bruges is the
center of western Flanders, one of the
largest lace contributing areas in Belgium,
and promises, therefore, to hold
for a long time her title of first lace-city.</p>

<p>It is strange to think of Turnhout as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>a remote town, since it is scarcely two
hours by motor from Antwerp; but the
first glimpse of the intervening sand
wastes of the Campine region awakens
at once a sensation of loneliness, of isolation.
I made the journey in late November,
reaching Turnhout about noon of
a low gray day, just as hundreds of
golden-haired children&mdash;no mists could
dull the bright gold of their hair&mdash;were
clattering along the stone sidewalks in
their wooden shoes, on their way home
from school. As always, I marveled at
the way they could leap and run without
losing their sabots. They were “lace
children,” nearly all of them part of the
little army of 1,800 in the lace-schools,
and because of the intelligent work of
the soup-kitchens and dining-rooms for
debilitated children during the four years
of war, were probably, many of them,
in better physical condition than they had
been at its beginning. The women of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Brussels Lace Committee had succeeded,
too, in augmenting their food ration from
time to time. Their chief visible need
was for stockings and shoes&mdash;and I knew
from the teachers later that they sadly
lacked underclothes. Mothers can patch
and repatch, and add in various ways to
outer garments; but after a certain number
of washings, undergarments simply
disappear.</p>

<p>I went first to the convent of the Abb&eacute;
Berraly which, during the war, encouraged
by the advice and support of the
Lace Committee, has developed into the
model school of Belgium. It is situated
in a crowded part of the town, but its
own fine brick buildings cluster about a
spacious courtyard and vegetable gardens.
In summer the children work
much out of doors, tho when they are
inside their class-rooms it seems still impossible
for the teachers to break with
the tradition of the closed window.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>I began my visit in a little room at
the right of the entrance hall, where six
older girls were still at work, tho the
500 other pupils had gone for their lunch.
Dozens of rubbed carbon copies of lace
patterns were pinned to the walls along
with executed samples of the lace they
represented. This was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqué</i> class-room;
the young women seated at high,
narrow tables, were carefully at work on
pieces of glossy green cardboard on
which the lace design had been drawn
and which they were pricking with pins,
or covering with tiny holes, that indicate
the position of the pins that must hold
the thread as it is twisted or looped or
braided, by the worker. The cardboard
piqu&eacute; is in a sense both the beginning
and the end of the lace course; the beginning,
since no pupil can start his lace
without the piqu&eacute;, or interpreted pattern,
and the end, since it is the most difficult
of all the processes in the technique of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>the lace. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</i> must understand
the design and its practical execution,
must interpret the picture to the worker
in terms of pin-pricks marking the progress
of her thread. A good <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</span>
knows immediately, on looking at a
drawing, whether it is a true lace design,
or must be adapted, and also in which
kind of lace it can be best exprest. As
she shifts a pin-prick less than a hair’s
width to the left or to the right she
varies appreciably the resulting mesh or
flower. She has considerable liberty in
deciding which particular stitches will be
most effective to fill in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jours</span>, or open-work
spaces indicated in the pattern.</p>

<p>One of the great evils of the past has
been the absence of training-schools, and
the consequent lack of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuses</span>; in each
generation there have been but a few
good ones, who have, in a sense, held
the lace industry in their hands. Before
the war, Ypres had two famous pique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>uses,
to whom patterns were sent from an
entire region; and in the town of Turnhout
to-day, with its thousands of workers,
tho there are several less experienced
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuses</span>, there is but one woman
to whom the finest and most complicated
drawings can be entrusted for interpretation.
She is the only person, for example,
who could make the piqu&eacute; for the
beautiful scarf, which I saw later being
executed in the Point de Paris room&mdash;for
that she received 90 francs. It is a common
saying that one must be born a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</span> to succeed; at least it remains
true that in addition to her capacity
for an intricate and most meticulous
labor, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</span> should possess a high
sensitiveness to art values.</p>

<p>The little room in the Abb&eacute; Berraly’s
school is one expression of the Lace
Committee’s conviction that the emancipation
of the industry and of the lace-maker
will come only through education.</p>

<p>In general the women of the past have
sat dumbly before their cushions, helpless
to do anything but continue to execute,
year after year, the particular cardboard
pattern the facteur, or lace agent, placed
before them. They had little or no conception
of the rich art world of which
their flowered flounces were a part, and
no feeling at all of their power to influence
that world by interpreting a design
for themselves, or by correcting or
improving it, or even perhaps by creating
a new one. Not that all workers should
become designers, or even <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuses</span>&mdash;progress
depends, as it does in other industries,
on specialization; but at least
trained workers will enjoy the freedom to
choose and the feeling of independence
that comes from a thorough knowledge
of their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m&eacute;tier</i>.</p>

<p>In this room then was a class of specialists,
six smiling, intelligent young
women between 16 and 18 equipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>themselves as experts in interpretation.
The designs on which they worked, many
of them revivals of classic ones long forgotten,
or beautiful recent creations of
Belgian artists, had been sent up to them
from the Committee’s central room of
design in Brussels. Before the war, they
would have come from the particular lace
dealer to whose agent their laces were
sold.</p>

<p>Opening from the little pattern room
I found the office with its great oak armoire,
where the costly finished laces are
stored until the day they are taken to
Brussels, to be combined into beautiful
confections for the salon or bedroom or
dining-room, or for personal adornment.
Of course, some are always resold by the
meter, but one of the chief successes of
the Lace Committee has been the employment
of motifs and yard laces in the production
of cloths and spreads and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>numerable
articles of a loveliness hitherto
unknown.</p>

<p>From the office and the little room
where the pricked cardboard patterns are
prepared for the cushions, I went further
along the hall, and turned to the left,
where at the foot of a staircase were
new wooden benches awaiting the sabots
of the returning children. These benches
were new because the Germans, who,
here as elsewhere, had driven the children
from their school, had burned their
benches, and not only the benches, but all
visible wood&mdash;they had torn casements
from the windows and doorways, as well
as removing every knob and fixture. This
was disgusting, but more or less understandable.
Their country demanded
more cannon, therefore they took brass
and copper; they were cold, so they
ripped off the nearest available piece of
wood. But wood and metal failed to
satisfy them; upstairs at one end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>largest room there is a pretty stage
arranged for school festivals, with a
painted forest background, and side wing-drops
picturing meadow-lands. These
fathers and brothers of German children
slashed and ripped the painted canvas
forest and ran their bayonets through the
foreground meadows, with no spur beyond
that of the pleasure in the act; for
no inch of the canvas had been taken
away&mdash;I could have replaced the whole
from the rags.</p>

<p>It was still only a little past one o’clock,
and the children had not yet returned. I
went into the beginners’ room, where
large windows let in all the light there
was on this gray day, and saw the long,
even rows of low rush-seated, high-backed
chairs, with the school-room sabots
(where the children were fortunate enough
to possess this second pair) hanging from
the backs. Before each chair was a
round or square work-cushion and over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>each cushion a white cloth carefully
spread to protect the precious thread-bearing
bobbins beneath. The whole
empty, silent place seemed prepared for
a ceremonial or religious rite; and every
snowy cushion a tiny altar awaiting its
ministrant.</p>

<p>At last they were coming back, the
younger children clattering in ahead of
the older girls, to deposit their muddy
street sabots on the benches. Such a
rush of yellow-haired babies for their
chairs&mdash;several of them were no more
than seven years old; many were between
nine and ten. Little feet slipt into the
clean sabots, white cloths were carefully
lifted and folded, sisters and teachers
began their rounds of inspection and instruction,
as tiny hands took their positions
over the heaps of bobbins&mdash;one at
the left, one at the right&mdash;and the cadence
of the clicking wood began. It was impossible
for me to follow these incredible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>little fingers as they twisted and braided
from pin to pin. I had seen scales so
rapidly played that the successive motions
were only a blur, but these shiftings
back and forth of the bobbins were even
more bewildering. More strangely moving
than the picture of any great orchestra
where gifted fingers wrung melody
from a myriad of strings, was this of the
play of hundreds of baby hands over
threads and bobbins, as the flowers blossomed
beneath them. It is said that to
become a good lace-maker one must
begin, as he would if he expected to become
a distinguished pianist, at latest at
the age of seven or eight.</p>

<p>The greater number of these little girls
were making Point de Paris edgings.
They had their pricked patterns pinned
near the top of the square linen-covered
cushions and were working the threads
vertically toward them. Since the pins
which hold the threads in place must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>constantly moved along as the work proceeds,
it is very important that the cushion
should be stuffed with something that
the pins can easily penetrate. These particular
cushions were stuffed with wool,
some contain straw, and the linen covering
was blue, tho it is often the natural
color. Besides guiding the tiny
brass pins (which vary with the delicacy
of the lace) that hold the thread, each
child must know how to manipulate the
long brass pins which separate the various
groups of bobbins not in actual use.
She learns, too, to roll each finished section
of her lace in blue paper and tuck
it carefully away in the little drawer
below the upper part of the cushion; the
true lace-maker prides herself on the
snowy whiteness of her lace, which she
protects in every conceivable way.</p>

<p>While I was moving from one to another,
a sister had gathered a group of
seven to ten year olds nearer the stove&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>a
company of Fra Angelico angels they
looked, as I bent over them to watch their
little hands. They placed brass pins in
the holes pricked in the pattern to hold
the rather coarse thread, twisted first two
threads to the right, then two to the left,
then braided them to form the familiar
hexagon of the Point de Paris mesh.
When they reached the pattern, a most
simple conventional one, other bobbins
had to be brought into play. They held
the threads always from the top of the
cushion vertically toward them, with the
seam edge of the lace to the left and the
border to the right. Even these babies
had from 50 to 200 bobbins to keep in
mind, rather long beech-wood bobbins,
these for Point de Paris, with the thread
tightly wound at the top, and a considerable
pear-shaped bulge at the end.
Each lace is supposed to require a particular
bobbin, especially suited to the
weight of thread employed, but workers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>often use them indifferently. Some fortunate
ones pride themselves on their fine
ebony or ivory sets. Of course, bobbins
must be constantly resupplied with
thread, and in a corner of the room I
saw a white-haired grandmother with her
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;vidoir</i>, or spindle, busily winding
thread on the bobbins for the children.
She made a beautiful picture there at her
wheel with a dozen little girls with their
cushions crowding near her. I asked if
the beginners were able to earn something
and found they were making about
10 and 15 cents a day.</p>

<p>In this model school, for all children
under sixteen years of age the lace work
alternates with regular lessons, as it should
of course, in every school. Those above
that age may give their entire day to
the lace. The hours for girls between
nine and thirteen are: from 8 to 11 o’clock,
lessons; from 1:30 to 4 o’clock, lessons
again; and from 4 to 6:30 o’clock, lace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>This is still a sadly long day for growing
children, but it nevertheless registers a
most cheering improvement over the former
cruelty of a far longer day. It has
been the Committee’s hope that such a
system as this might be instituted
throughout Belgium, and that from it
they might advance to still better conditions.
Children from thirteen to sixteen
come at 7:30 o’clock, make lace till 11:30,
and again from 1:30 to 4:45 o’clock. From
5 until 6:30 o’clock they have regular
school lessons&mdash;one wonders how much
education can be crowded into one and a
half hours at the end of a day that began at
7:30 o’clock! The girls over sixteen years
of age make lace from 7:30 until 6:30
o’clock. One thing to remember always,
in looking at these distressing figures, is
the frequent number of holidays in Belgium;
the children are saved by their
numerous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">f&ecirc;te</i> days.</p>

<p>It was not easy to leave the tragic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>and marvelous primary room; the fairy-like
fingers and the golden heads above
the cushions. But I had to go on to
room number one on the ground floor
where there was another Point de Paris
class, for girls about twelve years old. In
the Abb&eacute; Berraly school the girls must
pass through at least three classes in
Point de Paris before they proceed to
Point de Lille, to go on from there to the
“spider-web,” or delicate and most difficult
Malines.</p>

<p>The first striking difference between
this room and the primary, was in the
number of bobbins piled on the cushions&mdash;there
were hundreds now instead of
dozens. The cushions were larger, too,
and most of them were round, for many
of the pupils were working on collars and
doily and handkerchief edgings. The
designs were already complicated, one of
them represented, for instance, the animal
symbols of the allied nations. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>class promotes to the advanced class in
Point de Paris, where I found several
cushions with over 500 bobbins heaped
upon them, and girls of fourteen and fifteen
years shifting that number with a
swiftness not to be followed.</p>

<p>Since the heavy rain was making seeing
difficult, the teachers moved a number
of iron stands (resembling umbrella
stands) to various points in the room,
placing on top of each stand, in the middle,
a small kerosene lamp, and, near the
edge, a large globular carafe, filled with
water. The light from the lamp passes
through the bottle to fall with concentrated
and magnifying effect directly on
that spot on the cushion where the work
is in progress. The rack may be turned,
the bottle raised or lowered, and usually
four girls profit by the light from one lamp.
It is a picturesque and primitive system,
which many still prefer to the more modern
and expensive electricity, because it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>is an advantage to have the working spot
on the cushion thrown into high relief,
while at the same time the bottle light is
softer and less tiring to the eyes than
electricity. These iron stands and lamps
were very practical and satisfactory, but
I have often seen, in poor little rooms,
the bottle set on the table on a rough
wooden block, with a rude oil dip in a
cup propped up on bits of stick or stone
behind it to lift it to just the proper
height; as the work progresses, the position
of course must be altered.</p>

<p>While the girls were pulling their
chairs closer to the bottles I talked with
the teachers about the place of Point de
Paris in the lace world. There is no fine
lace, they told me, which is so much in
demand to-day as Point de Paris, for no
lace so successfully combines durability
and beauty. It is more used for dainty
lingerie than any other variety. Paris
buyers seem never to be able to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>sufficient Point de Paris, which tho
it was christened by that city and was
largely produced there during the <abbr title="seventeenth">17th</abbr>
century, must now be supplied by Belgium.
Its strength depends on its solid
hexagonal mesh, always the test of lace,
which is made with eight cotton threads,
usually of fairly coarse quality. From
this substantial mesh may blossom a pattern
of extreme grace and beauty, the
closely woven flat parts or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toile</span>, being
relieved by open-work spaces, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jours</span>,
and the whole design outlined and thus
thrown into a kind of relief by a heavier
thread. The roses of the Queen design,
drawn for the Brussels Committee by
<abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr> Brouhon (who has since died), is
one of the loveliest of the recent ones.
I saw, the other day, a box scented with
lavender and filled with rolls upon rolls
of this rose pattern lace, ready for the
day when a château can be restored, and
fine linen sheets and pillow slips with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>their Point de Paris edgings can once
again be spread on the beds.</p>

<p>Point de Lille could never be successfully
used for either lingerie or table or
bed linen for it is not sufficiently durable.
In room 3, girls from fourteen to sixteen
years were beginning to execute this more
difficult lace. Its clear, transparent mesh
originated in the city from which it is
named, where in 1788 there were as many
as 16,000 women employed on it. Its
fragility results from the fact that but
four threads (instead of the customary
eight of Point de Paris and Malines, and
of the mother of them all, Valenciennes)
are used in twisting and braiding the
meshes. On its light, clear mesh, the
designs are now often very elegant and
free, tho the traditional Point de Lille
edging has a straight border and rather
rigid pattern. They are always outlined
by a heavier thread, as are the flowers of
the Point de Paris and Malines, but unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
these other laces, the Point de Lille
is characterized by little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pois</i>, or peas or
dots, scattered through the mesh. It is
sometimes confused with Malines because
of the transparency of its mesh, which,
however, is not so delicate as that of
Malines, nor so difficult to make, nor,
because of its fewer threads, so solid.</p>

<p>One of the most popular and more
solid varieties of Point de Lille is better
known as Point d’Hollande, because it is
chiefly sold to the well-to-do Dutch peasants
for their handsome bonnets. It is
wide and often of sumptuous design, a
sole branch or flower frequently furnishing
the entire wing of a bonnet.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">IN THE ABBÉ BERRALY SCHOOL, COLETTE, 16
YEARS OLD, WORKS WITH 1,000 BOBBINS</p>
</div>

<p>In the class-room, I went directly to a
dark-haired Josephine, whose cushion
seemed to hold the largest mounds of
bobbins&mdash;“Yes, there are over a thousand,”
she admitted shyly and smilingly.
The directress came to help her open the
little drawer beneath her round cushion,
and to shake from the blue paper a most
lovely wide scarf with a charming flower
design. “I began it last January,” she
added, “and I hope to finish it this January
of 1919.” One year with a thousand
bobbins, and at best 50 cents a day
for her work&mdash;which was so much more
than she could have made before the war
that she had no thought of complaining!
I wondered if the woman who would
throw this filmy flower-sown veil over her
shoulders would care to know about the
dark-eyed Josephine and her year with
the 1,000 bobbins.</p>

<p>But there is much more beautiful lace
than either Point de Paris or Point de
Lille taught in the Turnhout school. The
girls pass from the Lille room to Malines,
known in the city of its birth as the
“spider-web of Malines.” Nothing could
be more airy and exquisite than its delicate
hexagonal mesh, much more difficult to
make than either of the preceding varieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
because it must be worked without
the aid of pins, with only the eye to guide
in securing the requisite uniformity and
exactness. No lace demands greater skill
or greater patience; since in addition to
the difficulty of working without supporting
pins, is the difficulty of handling the
extremely fine thread employed. The
patterns are usually of delicate flowers
and leaves, with open-work stitches introduced
to add ever greater lightness to
the whole.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span> in the Malines room
work chiefly on insertions and flounces
to be used for handkerchiefs or fichus or
dainty blouses, or perhaps for wedding
gowns. The Committee has given them,
too, many orders for inserts for table centers
or doilies, so exquisite that one feels
they should be used only under glass.</p>

<p>Scarcely an important family in Belgium
but treasures a bit of old Malines.
Among my rarest pleasures were those I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>enjoyed, when the conversation turning
upon lace, a friend has said: “But would
you care to see my mother’s Malines, or
my great, great-grandmother’s?”&mdash;and
she has brought from a brocade box a
filmy, ivory-colored collar or flounce, or
a scarf or bonnet, all of a breath-taking
loveliness and delicacy never to be reproduced.
I remember, too, a Christmas
mass and the marvelous flounce that fell
from beneath the white and gold chasuble
worn by Cardinal Mercier over the scarlet
of his robe.</p>

<p>It is only in Turnhout that any considerable
quantity of Malines is yet made,
and despite all the efforts of the Committee
and of other lovers of beautiful
lace, there is little hope that it will live
much longer. When the old artists, for
so they should be named, die, few young
women are found willing still to sacrifice
their years to the spider-web.</p>

<p>The women of the Lace Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>believe there is no future work more important
than that of improving the 200
and more lace schools of their country.
In the lace normal school at Bruges, in
the national school of design at Brussels,
the excellent Needle Point school at Zele,
and in such schools as this one at Turnhout,
they see the hope of the lace art;
they urge that the Government increase
its subsidies to these and other deserving
institutions. Education and ever better
education of the lace-woman is their
watchword.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> years I had heard of the blue
flax fields of the valley of the Lys,
and of the season between April and
September, when along miles of its
course, the river is filled with boxes floating
the finest linen fiber of the world,
the flax of Belgium, North France and
Holland, which can be better prepared
in its waters than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I could see it only under
a January rain, but Monsieur de Stoop,
a prominent weaver of Courtrai, the town
of 36,000 inhabitants which is the valley
center, made the Flanders fields bloom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>again as he described to me the successive
steps which lead from them to the woven
linen his factory produces&mdash;I should say,
produced, for the Germans left his plant,
along with seven others, an utter ruin.
He was unable to explain and apparently
no analysis has yet determined, just why
the waters of the Lys river surpass all
others in their power to rot the encasing
straw and generally to cleanse the flax;
but one thing is clear, they have established
Courtrai as a world market for fine
raw linen. Sometimes the stalks need be
floated only two or three days, sometimes
it requires very much longer to macerate
them, the period depending chiefly on the
weather, and particularly on the temperature.</p>

<p>After its soaking and cleansing, the
linen fiber starts again on its journey,
this time to the various countries where
it is to be made into thread and woven
into tissues. Much goes to England and
to Ireland, to such firms as Beth and Cox.
From there it returns to Belgium in the
form of linen thread for fine laces, quite
a different variety, of course, from that
employed in sewing. Lace thread, both
cotton and linen, may be used for sewing,
but never sewing-thread for good lace.
An outsider can scarcely estimate the importance
of the quality of the thread to
the lace-maker. Of two skeins bearing
the same number, one may be supple and
easily led, while the other is brittle and
wayward. We hear many stories of how
women used to spend their lives in damp
cellars, in order to keep their thread
moist and soft. I have been told several
times, for instance, that a certain piece
of lace had been made below ground,
because only there was its marvelous
technique possible. Whatever the degree
of truth or legend in these assertions, it is
known that the rarest laces require certain
atmospheric conditions, and are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>above all, dependent on a superior fineness
and pliability of the thread.</p>

<p>The English and Irish spinneries lead
the world; they produce most of its lace
thread. One of them; the Coates firm
of Paisley, has established in Belgium
branches in which Belgian capital is interested,&mdash;at
Gent are the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filteries</i>, which
prepare thread for weaving, and at Alost
and Ninove are the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filatures</i> or spinneries
which turn out the finished sewing and
embroidery thread. The cottons and
linens of these mills are too coarse for
the delicate laces; however, during a single
war year, the Brussels Committee was
happy to be able to buy from Alost as
much as 600,000 francs worth of thread.
By some miracle, the Ghent filteries escaped
the practically universal ruin visited
on mills and factories, and should be
operating before peace is signed, but for
the spinneries of Alost and Ninove, the
future is still dark.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>During two years the enemy, feeling
they might one day run the mills where
they stood, left them intact, tho they
requisitioned their stocks of thread. Then
as they saw they might not perhaps be
able to continue their beneficent occupation
of Belgium, even if they won the
war, they began to remove the mill machinery
to Germany. They were especially
ruthless when the mills were known
to be of English or French ownership.
They stole the secrets of the factories
and finally they deported the workmen.
These men are scattered everywhere.
Even if the machines of the factories
were not completely destroyed it would
be impossible under a considerable time
to reassemble the skilled workmen essential
to the spinning industry. The Germans
will undoubtedly try to capture the
trade, and to market their goods, if they
must, through such neutral countries as
Denmark and Switzerland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>When I arrived at Courtrai, Monsieur
and his family were just moving back
into the house from which they had been
ejected. They apologized for the room
they so hospitably offered me, in which
the original bed had been replaced by an
iron one they recognized as having belonged
to an English family of Courtrai.
The brass trimmings were gone, and the
mattress had of course been removed, but
Madame had been able to find one stuffed
with sea-moss for me. The curtains were
slashed, blocks of wood nailed to the
once handsome walls, there were no
lights, no metal knobs or fixtures of any
kind, no service wires left. Below, the
cellar had been almost filled with concrete
to provide the conqueror a safe
refuge during danger periods. It requires
a special kind of courage to take
up life again in a place like this, but these
good people said: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>“We can not complain,
we are so much better off than others,
and at least we have saved our health;
with that we can be sure of being able to
build again what they have destroyed.”</p>

<p>From there I went to Baron de
Bethune, a connoisseur of laces, who had
before the war opened a lace museum in
Courtrai, chiefly for Valenciennes. I
found him ill in a little house in the town;
he had long before been driven from his
château in the suburbs. His sister, who
had with great difficulty made her way
from Louvain, received me with apologies
in the midst of a heterogeny of
boxes and packages, the few personal
possessions they had gathered together in
the hope of some day having a home
again. I was not to see the old Valenciennes
and other specimens of the famous
lace days of Courtrai; fortunately
for his museum, Monsieur had succeeded
in getting them to Brussels where they
were still, to my personal regret, hidden
away. However, I was not surprized,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>for I had been unable before starting for
Flanders to see the celebrated collection
of the Cinquantenaire Museum at Brussels,
for that, too, had been successfully
secreted. Museums are slow in rehanging
their treasures. Even tho the presence
of the three neutral Ministers, the
Spanish, American and Dutch, in the capital,
was supposed to be a guaranty of
protection to the national collections, and
undoubtedly it was only their presence
that prevented in Belgium what happened
to the Museums of Northern
France, the Belgians with unwearying
ingenuity concealed what they could.
Whenever I hear of hidden laces, I am
reminded of a morning at Malines and a
sad little basket containing a fine collection
of old Malines lace, I saw exhumed.
It had been buried deep in a box, along
with the family silver, and as the daughter
of the mother who had worn it took
its once lovely flowers and webs, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>gray and earth-stained, between her fingers,
they powdered to dust.</p>

<p>Monsieur suggested that I see <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr>
Mullie, a leading dealer of Courtrai, who
still handles a large output of Valenciennes;
tho Courtrai, which was once
a brilliant production center, is no longer
of great importance. After the French
Revolution, which killed Valenciennes-making
in its original home, it migrated
to other parts of Northern France, and
to the two Flanders; to Ypres, where it
enjoyed an especially happy development,
to Bruges, Ghent, Dixmude, Furnes,
Menin, Nieuport, Poperinghe and elsewhere.
For a long time Ghent led all
these, with over 5,000 workers listed in
1756. But starvation wages and successful
imitations have told against this, as
against other laces. Nevertheless, in the
census of 1896, Bruges was still credited
with 2,000 Valenciennes workers, and
Poperinghe with 500, while there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>scattered groups of considerable importance
in a great number of the villages of
Western, and some of Eastern Flanders.</p>

<p>Courtrai and the nearby villages where
the lace is actually made, still stand,
tho many buildings have been destroyed,
but while her people were not
forced to become refugees, lace-making
was seriously interrupted; workers were
evicted from their homes and their
schools. And they suffered further because
there was scarcely any thread left,
the dealers often asking as much as 20
cents for ¾ of a yard of lace thread,
about the previous value of the same
length in finished lace. Under these conditions
it was especially easy to see the
importance of the efforts of the Brussels
Lace Committee, which furnished thread
at the normal price, and gave more for
the lace than was ever offered before
the war.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the German facteurs
(agents for lace dealers) worked cleverly
here, too, as in other districts. They
had always plenty of requisitioned thread
to offer, and succeeded in buying considerable
lace, for which they offered
high and varying prices.</p>

<p>The younger women of the Courtrai
region have been rapidly giving up Valenciennes
to make Cluny, which pays better.
A Valenciennes beginner, for example,
must work a year as an apprentice,
during which time she is able to earn
scarcely more than five cents a day. The
wages of the good workers have advanced,
but unless they can be increased
even more, there are few who will continue
to make this difficult lace.</p>

<p>After 60 years’ experience in lace, and
latterly she has employed 1,000 women,
<abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr> Mullie says that one is fortunate,
among 5,000 workers, to find five who can
execute a sample from a drawing not
already interpreted or pricked for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>worker. Before the war there were two
good <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuses</span> in Ypres to whom Courtrai
sent her difficult patterns, but only
one of these still lives.</p>

<p>In peace-time the greater part of this
Courtrai lace goes to Paris (some is sent
to New York), which is all one needs to
say in tribute to its pattern and its quality.
Paris knows lace better than any
other city in the world; she accepts only
the best. We were talking of the 60 per
cent. duty the United States Government
levies on imported laces, and the harm it
works to the Belgian industry. “That is
our greatest discouragement, but there
are other Government stupidities,” <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr>
Mullie smiled. “France, for instance,
charges 10½ francs on a kilo of Valenciennes,
and the same amount on an equal
weight of Cluny; the Valenciennes may
be worth several thousand, and the Cluny
three or four francs!”</p>

<p>The true old Valenciennes mesh, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>“Rond,” is still made at Courtrai, as
well as at Bruges; the modern Valenciennes
commonly has a square mesh,
which is preferred by many connoisseurs,
since it is more transparent and sets the
flowers off more strikingly. “Whether
or not you prefer it to the square, you
must see the traditional round Valenciennes
mesh,” <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr> Mullie said, and
we started off in the rain for a group of
tiny brick houses, the Gottshuisen (God’s
houses) which the city furnishes free to
certain old people.</p>

<p>Before we reached the first, I saw two
white heads near a window, bending over
cushions; and once inside, on those cushions,
lengths of snowy Valenciennes of
the old round mesh, of an admirable regularity
and loveliness. These two women
were both over 70 years old, and they
sat before their bobbins, twisting and
braiding the eight threads of the mesh as
they had twisted and braided them for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>over a half century, and still cheerfully
hoping that they might some day win
more than 15 or 20 cents a day for their
work. “Now we must have more,” they
said gently, “because thread and oil are
so much more expensive than they were
before the war.”</p>

<p>In the next house, the old woman
whose sister was ill could afford no light
at all; when dusk fell she had to leave
her bobbin mounds and her mesh and
flowers and go to bed&mdash;what else could
she do without coal or oil?</p>

<p>It was the last day of 1918, and I
decided that Mrs. Bayard Henry of Philadelphia,
who had sent me a little money
to use as I chose, would be happy to give
to these sweet, faithful women and their
thirteen neighbors, candles and oil as
hope symbols for the New Year. I left
her gift with <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr> Mullie.</p>

<p>It was already very late, and I had
not time to go to Wevelghem and Gulleghem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
two of the most important lace-villages
contributing to Courtrai. <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr>
Mullie was facing the future with courage.
“I am sure,” she said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>“that Peat,
from whom I have bought thread for
forty years, will not forget me, and that I
may be able to count on a shipment from
England at a just price as soon as anything
can come through. That I have
been cut off during four years will make
no difference. I shall write, too, to a
friend in France, and from Puy I may
have a few skeins. The question of pins
and bobbins is serious&mdash;they seem to have
disappeared, and one can not start a
worker on less than a dozen bobbins.
Those I have thus far succeeded in finding
cost 95 centimes the dozen, as against
the 28 centimes of pre-war times. There
seem literally to be no pins. However,
despite everything, I, at least, hope to see
my thousand women at some not too distant
time again busy over their cushions.
A few have already sought me out to
let me know they are ready, waiting only
for the precious thread. I regret infinitely
the passing of the fine ‘Val,’ but we
shall continue to produce as much as we
can, and at any rate we shall try unceasingly
to raise the standard of the
Clunys and Torchons.”</p>

<small><i>In the Important Bobbin Lace Area</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> a spring-like Saturday in early
January, I left Bruges by the
Thourout road for Thielt. As I turned
beyond the Porte, I found myself
speeding toward the great arms of one
of those Dutch windmills that so frequently,
in the lowlands, close the long
vista. The farther I rode into the Thourout
region, the more it seemed the loveliest
bit of Western Flanders I had yet
seen. The gentle outlines of the low red
brick farmhouses followed with satisfying
harmony the landscape contours.
Farm succeeded farm in swift succession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
small farms, where every square foot of
soil was green with sprouting grain or
vegetables, and in the morning sunlight
the thickly sown cottages shone like
jewels on the plain.</p>

<p>Pink and white geraniums blossomed
behind many of the quaint windows, and
I knew that near them grandmothers, or
mothers, or daughters (or possibly all
three together) were sitting before their
cushions, and from pin to pin were twisting
and braiding Cluny and Duchesse,
the characteristic laces of this section.
This was an excellent day for lace-making
with its sunshine of summer.</p>

<p>To the south and east of the badly
shelled town of Thourout, I visited the districts
of Iseghem, Thielt and Wynghene,
all celebrated for their guipures. Guipure,
a rather vague commercial term covering
two widely different groups of lace, may
be loosely defined as bobbin lace without
a mesh base. One group of guipures includes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the Clunys (named after the Cluny
museum in Paris because they employ
many old Gothic designs) which are
made in one length or piece. They
closely resemble the more common Torchons,
surpassing them, however, in fineness
and firmness of execution, and in
brilliancy of design&mdash;the distinguishing
connecting bars of Cluny often throw the
figures into conspicuous relief. While
this one-piece lace is usually made of the
coarser threads, fine linen or cotton, or
even silk thread, is also employed. In
the second group of guipures are those
made in separate small bits, or details,
which are afterward joined to make the
flounce or piece, the most common of
these varieties being Flanders and
Duchesse. In the schools of Thielt and
Wynghene all the kinds are taught. Because
they are made of coarser thread
and therefore more quickly than such
laces as Valenciennes or Needle Point,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>are less taxing to the eyes, and pay better,
these guipures have gained ground
in almost every lace center in Belgium,
and often threaten the very existence of
the finer laces. If it had not been for
the leadership of the “Amies de la Dentelle,”
of a few of the more intelligent
and disinterested dealers, and above all
of certain convents to whom Belgium
owes the preservation of many of her
finest designs and varieties, it is a question
if any but the few remaining old
women, who for forty or fifty years have
preferred to follow one pattern, would
still produce the old meshes and points.
Much hope now centers in the corrective
influence of the recently founded Normal
School at Bruges and of the other schools
of Belgium, but, despite all the efforts of
these combined groups, delicate laces like
the Malines have been fast disappearing.</p>

<p>The little farmhouse, if one can call
two rooms a house, I visited on the edge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>of Thielt demonstrated clearly what is
happening. It was Saturday afternoon
and the mother of the large family of
boys at play on the neat brick path outside,
was scrubbing the tiled floor, moving
the small baskets of potatoes and
heaps of tobacco leaves and sabots and
the winter sled from place to place as
she proceeded. The socks to be darned,
each already a fantastic patchwork, were
piled on the window-sill, where there was
room beside for a geranium and a fern.
The stove and the table were also crowded
into this, the general living-room, which
despite all attempts to arrange things,
boasted scarcely one unincumbered foot
of floor space. However, over near the
window with its two plants, were the
customary chair and the cushion, and the
girl of sixteen, absorbed in her lace,
quite oblivious of the water her mother
was splashing about her feet.</p>

<p>The adjoining room was similarly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>crowded; it had to serve as bedroom for
this large family. There was the mantel-piece
with the familiar row of bright
plates and vases,&mdash;the place where the
family’s art sense finds concentrated expression.
Fortunately, this room, too,
had a window with other plants, and before
it sat the grandmother in her black
cap and shawl, who, as I entered, was just
slipping her battered eye-glasses into the
little side drawer beneath her cushion.
She smiled a friendly greeting, and uncovered
her lace, a filmy flounce of Valenciennes
about four inches wide, firm
and regular, and of a good old design.
She had been making Valenciennes all
her life; she would make it to the end.
She was delighted to show me how she
twisted four threads to form one side of
the hexagon of the mesh, and four to
form the opposite, and the union points
where the eight met. Then she held up
a length of her lace and told us that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>facteur (neighborhood buyer for a large
business house) had been there just before
we arrived, to try to buy her flounce
at nine francs the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aune</i>, which would be
roughly, about $2.50 a meter. The committee
has been giving her 19 fr. 50 c.
($3.90) for the same amount, and she
asked anxiously, tho still smilingly, if she
might not continue to hope for the committee
price, even tho the war had stopt.
It is pathetic, day after day, to hear that
question repeated, and not yet to be certain
of the answer. However, one can always
reply truthfully, that the women of
the “Friends of the Lace” will work unceasingly
not only to hold wages where
they are, but to advance them.</p>

<p>I turned from this delicate lace to the
granddaughter’s cushion&mdash;she was making
guipure de Cluny, of coarse linen
thread. Marie’s pattern happened to be
a good one and she was working swiftly
and evenly, sure of a fair day’s wage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>Here, then, was a suggestive contrast,
and however one may regret it, it exists
in the large majority of lace-making
households in Belgium, and is only to be
expected. It is but the deserved penalty
of a past and present economic blindness
or callousness. Where they are not making
Cluny, the younger women of this district
give their time to ordinary varieties
of guipure which they call Bruges and
Milan, or Point de Bruges, and Point
de Milan.</p>

<p>While I had been watching the Valenciennes
and Cluny, the mother of the
household, who had the mop of fuzzy
dark red hair often seen in this region,
had hurried her scrubbing to an end, and
wiping her hands on her blue apron, was
ready to uncover her own cushion. I
looked at the chapped, rough skin and
the hands used to pulling weeds and digging
potatoes and scrubbing, and realized
that they could not possibly hold a piece
of fine sewing&mdash;the thread would catch
with every stitch&mdash;and yet that she could
turn from her scrubbing-brush to the
little wooden bobbins (her fingers need
not touch the thread) and proceed without
difficulty on a snowy bit of Valenciennes&mdash;for
happily she was following
her mother in Valenciennes.</p>

<p>There are three schools in Thielt, of
which the convent schools de la Charit&eacute;
and de l’Esp&eacute;rance are the more important.
I went first to the Convent de
la Charit&eacute;, with <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr> van der Graeht,
who has throughout the war been devoted
to the workers and the lace. Tho Thielt
lay in the danger zone, she refused to
choose a safer city, remaining to share
the work of her father, who added to
his arduous duties as administrator of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrondisement</i>, those of the representative
of the Brussels Lace Committee.
Two weeks before the end, however, the
Germans drove these patriots from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>house (three bombs from Allied aeroplanes
had already fallen on it) and they
were denied the experience they had
been waiting for throughout all the
years, that of seeing the Allied soldiers
march into Thielt. One of the Germans
was frank enough to tell them that they
were being forced away chiefly to prevent
their “assisting” at that deliverance.</p>

<p>Immediately after the armistice they
returned, and installed themselves comfortably
once more on the first floor of
their almost roofless house. When I
arrived they had not yet come in from
their first inspection trip of the communes
just behind the lines, and I was
welcomed by pretty, brown-haired Flavia
and her six-year-old Albert. Flavia’s
husband had been killed at the front during
the first months of the war, and she
had served in this household throughout
all its terrible duration. As I looked from
the windows of the drawing-room, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>intact, across the rear garden, to the
mass of wreckage that was once the neighboring
house, I understood the feeling
of the impotence of all effort produced
by the casualness of these bombs, that
spare here to strike there, and why in
the war one inevitably becomes a fatalist.
And as I looked across the garden, Flavia
told me something of her experience with
the thirteen Germans who took over the
house when they drove her master out
and of how whenever the shelling was
severe they ran to the cellars, and several
times tried to persuade her to go with
them but she always refused. “I preferred,”
she said, “to die alone with my
little boy in the open, to risking being
killed with them in the cellar.” On Sunday,
October 13, between 11 and 2 o’clock,
sixty shells fell on Thielt, and all day
Monday and the following days they
continued to fall, until on Saturday the
<abbr title="nineteenth">19th</abbr>, the French marched into the town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>To add to the horror of this period, people
were dying in large numbers of influenza.
Flavia told me of the street-sweeper
who died at the corner with her
broom in her hand. By some miracle she
and her little boy escaped both shell and
pestilence, and when Monsieur and his
daughter returned they found her scrubbing
and restoring as best she could after
the flight of the enemy. This was one of
the centers where during the four terror-years
a bright beacon burned for all
the surrounding territory, for it was here
that the people of the villages and the
convents could bring their laces for the
committee, knowing they would be accepted
and paid for. In 1916, the Baron
van der Graeht was encouraging the work
in no less than seventeen communes and
of as many as 3,500 lace-workers. Flavia
smiled as she remembered something&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>“What
good luck, there will be a sister
coming this very day about 2 o’clock, with
her laces.” As she said this, the door
opened&mdash;father and daughter were back
from their pony-cart expedition to the
front-lines.</p>

<p>Monsieur was still visibly moved by
what he had seen, even after his own four
years’ experience. “Madame,” he said,
“I can not describe my emotion on going
about in those little shattered villages
just behind the lines, where the women
have insisted on remaining, and where
day by day, and year after year, they
have sat calmly before their cushions
making lace, while the shells burst before
and behind them. After such a victory
as theirs, the lace industry of Belgium
must live.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle gave me the list of the
badly destroyed villages, and then the
names of those which had suffered less
and that, with Thielt, produced the most
lace. Among them were Pittham and
Ardois (which specializes in old Bruges);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>Ruysselede (with an excellent school for
Valenciennes), Aerseele, and Maria Loop.
Thielt, itself, had at the beginning of
1919 about 300 workers, of whom a hundred
were in the school of the convent
de l’Esp&eacute;rance, and about 60 in the Convent
de la Charit&eacute;. There had been times
of great discouragement; in one particularly
dark hour in 1917 many of the
workers had turned back to the old
facteurs, or village agents, for help, and
unfortunately some of these sold to the
Germans, who were constantly trying to
win them by offering large sums for their
laces. Since he was under no obligation
to turn over a fixt wage to the workers,
the facteur might reap any profit he
could secure.</p>

<p>We abandoned this unpleasant subject
to talk of the schools, the hope of the
future, and after lunch I went with <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr>
to visit one of these, the Convent de la
Charit&eacute;, on the edge of the town, with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>60 girls, who have supplied the committee
with much old Flanders and Cluny. Even
tho this was a Saturday afternoon in
winter, 45 of the 60 chairs were occupied
by girls between 12 and 16. One rarely
finds a girl over 18 in the schools; once
she has learned her trade, she prefers to
work at home with the mother and grandmother.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in this, which is considered
a “good” school for Flanders, I
found the longest hours I had yet met,
that is, summer hours. In winter, because
of the poor light, they are shorter. It
seems unbelievable, but the sisters told
me that in summer the children come at
5:30 o’clock and work until 8 at night&mdash;with
only three half-hours for recreation&mdash;one
at 8:30 o’clock, one at 12, and
one at 4. A day of 13 hours for growing
children, and girls who are maturing!
It is such cruel conditions as these that
the Committee have done their best to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>ameliorate. In this case, tho the hours
are still criminal, the wages have been
improved.</p>

<p>However, “improved wages” leave
much still to be fought for. I talked
with a girl of twelve in the front row, an
apprentice, and found that she earns between
40 and 50 centimes a day, or about
10 cents for her 13 hours’ labor, which
tho it is almost double what she could
have earned before the war, is nevertheless
only 10 cents per day. The Committee
was able to add the war-time subsidy
of 20 per cent. to this. Naturally,
the learner can not yet make what is
called good lace, and unfortunately her
parents are often only too content to have
her bring home 10 cents a day. The
older, more experienced girls, were earning
from one to two francs a day, or from
20 to 40 cents, that is, on a summer’s day
or full day.</p>

<p>Monsieur told me later that in his region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
if the wage of the good worker can be
raised to 50 cents per day, she will
be able to live, and will be content to
remain at home before her lace cushion
rather than to go to the shoe and cotton
factories of Thielt.</p>

<p>The advanced pupils were eager to uncover
their treasure. Nearly all of them
had protected their round cushions with a
circular piece of thick blue glazed paper,
with a hole in the middle. Through the
hole they worked with their rather heavy
cherry wood bobbins, on the meshless
guipures of Cluny and Bruges and Flanders,
which this school prefers. Several
were finishing the collar and cuff sets of
rather coarse but pretty Bruges with its
characteristic rose and trefoil, seen so
commonly in shop windows, and which
are especially effective when worn with
cotton or linen frocks. The Guipure de
Flandres pupils were making square insets
for table and tray-cloths of simple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>geometric designs. Two girls were at
work on what they called Guipure de
Milan, of a wide spreading branch and
flower pattern.</p>

<p>However, the most interesting lace
was not the guipure but the Point de
Flandres or Old Flanders, with its elaborate
mesh base, just now experiencing
an interesting and encouraging revival,
in which the zealous Baron van der
Graeht felt Thielt should assist. A half-dozen
older girls were executing doily
and table center rounds in this lace, after
the Committee’s very popular Swan pattern.
They were using a fairly coarse
linen thread, and working the rich, solid
mesh with eight bobbins. “Whoever
would make the Old Flanders mesh must
be willing to play a game of patience,”
Madame had once said to me. The dull,
plain woven parts of the pattern are
brilliantly outlined by a still coarser
thread, and in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jours</span>” or open-work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>spaces are the much loved snow-balls
characteristic of Binche lace. Because of
its combined strength and beauty, there
could hardly be a more successful lace
for general use than this Old Flanders,
sometimes called Antik.</p>

<p>While it was once the most generally
made and most celebrated of Flemish
bobbin laces (it was known in every part
of Flanders in 1500), it had been almost
forgotten for generations, but even
tho it has been little remembered for
some time, Old Flanders may be said
never to have died. In certain regions,
that of Antwerp for instance, it is found
continuously on the garments of priests.
It is the lace that remained always at the
base and from which the other bobbin
laces, from time to time, sprang. It is
to be hoped that the Committee’s laudable
effort to revive it will bear increasing rewards.</p>

<p>Tho they could understand no French,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>and I knew only a few words of Flemish,
these little and big girls found much
amusement in my visit, and in my inability
to follow their swift fingers. These
were fingers accustomed, too, to weed the
fields and to dig potatoes, for there is
practically no lace made here during the
weeks of August and September when
the potato-crop is gathered. The Sisters
of Charity, teachers in this school, were
poor themselves, as their surroundings
testified. They had no fine carved oak
armoire for their laces, but brought from
some safe place a tin box, like an ordinary
bread-box, in which were the dainty
white packets ready to be sent to the
Committee at Brussels. As they were
exhibiting piece after lovely piece, they
unfolded the swan pattern doily rounds
of Old Flanders, and after a moment’s
hesitation, Sister A. ventured, “There is
one thing you might do for us, Madame;
when you return to Brussels, could you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>not tell the Committee that while the
small swan doily rounds are sufficiently
paid, this large centerpiece round is not?
It is our fault in estimating; we did not
realize how long it would take to make
it.” I could not resist teasing them a
little and replied that I should be delighted
to carry the message were it not
for the fact that it was precisely this set
of swan doilies (as it was) that the Committee
had given me for Christmas.
“Should you like me to tell them,” I
asked, “that they had not paid enough
for my present?” They were covered
with confusion, as I expected they would
be, and then how they laughed, those
frail little sisters. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais</i>, Madame, that
would indeed be difficult; we will write;
we had forgotten. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non</i>, Madame, you
certainly could not tell them that! But
we can write letters now whenever we
wish&mdash;can we not? One loses the habit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>in four years.” And then they laughed
again all together.</p>

<p>It was already late when I reached
Wynghene. The shell-pitted roads of
western Flanders had made all my traveling
difficult and I could not see <abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr>
Slock, one of the rare lace dealers who
has looked beyond her immediate purse
and has taken time to revive old models
and invent new ones, seeking in every
way to raise the standard of the present
production in all her region, which is
chiefly devoted to Cluny. I had not time
to stop in the village, but hurried on beyond
it to a cheerful red brick manor
house set in a forest, the home of the
Burgomaster of Wynghene, whose wife
has been the untiringly devoted representative
of the Committee for this section.</p>

<p>As we sat at tea together, near the conservatory
windows, where we could look
through the naked garden trees across a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>meadow to the forest beyond, the Burgomaster
told me of the morning when they
stood at these windows, after the shells
had been falling for days all about them,
waiting and watching, scarcely daring to
breathe, and of how as they watched, he
saw through the trees of the forest what
looked like a brown shadow, but the
brown shadow moved, and then running
across the meadow, where he had always
believed they must break through, came
the Belgian soldiers, the soldiers of deliverance.
“I know our hearts stopt beating;
we stood choking, incapable of motion,
as we watched them come&mdash;still
unable to believe after four years of waiting.”</p>

<p>We were silent for a few minutes, then
we began to talk of the lace. As his wife
turned to get the list of her villages, I
asked if the Germans had attempted to
get her workers away from her. “They
had their agents here, as everywhere,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>she answered, “and I regret to admit that
one of their most successful ones was a
Belgian woman, who had been a facteur,
or lace gatherer for larger houses, before
the war. When the Germans offered
her large prices, she consented to serve
them. If she had been sacrificing herself
for what she believed to be the good of
the workers, we might have forgiven her,
but it was obvious that she was not&mdash;she
is pretty and likes pretty clothes&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voil&agrave;
tout!</i> Along with several other disloyal
citizens, she was imprisoned the other
day, but unfortunately after only twenty-four
hours, succeeded in freeing herself.
However, the people will never forget
that she trafficked with the enemy.”</p>

<p>I had known of the German lace organization
first through seeing the huge sign,
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allgemeine Spitzen Centrale</i>” (Central
lace depot), just across from our C. R. B.
offices. And as soon as I got in touch
with the loyal work of the women of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Belgian Lace Committee, I was daily
hearing of this or that attempt of their
oppressors to capture the designs and the
output of the country. They might succeed
with the simpler, more helpless
workers, who because of their great
misery may be forgiven for selling to
them&mdash;and with the deserters and
activists&mdash;but they were daily defeated
by the Committee patriots. I was
thoroughly interested to hear, now, from
one of the patriots, that the idea of the
German “Lace Control” possibly had its
birth in Wynghene. In February, 1915,
a certain Freiherr Von Rippenhausen
was stationed at Wynghene. He had
with him his young American wife&mdash;they
had been married but a short time, and
the people of the village were kind enough
to say they believed she was not German
by conviction! However that may be,
the Von Rippenhausens requisitioned
lodgings in the house of one of the lace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>buyers of Wynghene, and in this house
they naturally discovered much regarding
the lace situation, the lack of
thread, and the distress of the workers,
and of the Belgian system by which the
facteur furnishes the thread to the
worker and buys the finished products,
which he in turn sells to a big lace house,
reaping what profit he can as intermediary.
Frau von Rippenhausen, in
particular, informed herself thoroughly,
and together she and her husband, it is
said, organized the German “Lace Control,”
with headquarters at Brussels.</p>

<p>Since the Germans had requisitioned
all the thread they could lay their hands
on, of which there were enormous stocks
in Belgium, it was not difficult for them
to offer it to the workers. They sent
German soldier facteurs into every
corner of the country to offer large prices
to native facteurs or to individual
workers. On receiving a piece of lace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>they supplied an equal weight of thread
to the workers, thus establishing a continuing
chain of material and product.
And they claimed to be selling their lace
in America! They were clever enough
to profit, in 1917, by the Committee’s apparent
inability to go on at that moment,
exercising every pressure they could, and
naturally they gained ground. No one
can say yet how much lace they were able
to buy, but the amount of inferior lace
was considerable.</p>

<p>Madame Van der Bruggen’s records
show that before 1917 there were in
Wynghene, contributing to the Committee,
400 workers on Cluny and Duchesse,
about 200 on Cluny and Valenciennes in
Beernem, 200 on Valenciennes in
Oedelem, and 350 in Oostcamp, all grateful
to have the Committee’s fixt minimum
of three francs’ work a week insured
to them. Some of these villages,
Beernem and Oostcamp for instance, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>usually included in the Bruges district.</p>

<p>She praised the Committee’s method of
raising the wage by standardizing the
values of certain designs as executed by
an average worker; the poorer workers
then gained less, the superior ones, more.
“I thought I realized,” she said, “how
cruelly underpaid our women were, but it
was not until I saw their joy when the
Committee promised them that at least
they should always have a minimum of ten
centimes an hour for their work, that I
really understood. Ten centimes (two
cents), just a postage stamp, for a whole
hour’s straining effort; and they were
happy because that was so much more
than they had been sure of winning before
the war!”</p>

<a name="GRAMMONT" id="GRAMMONT"></a>GRAMMONT<br />

<small><i>Belgian Home of Chantilly</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Committee was discouraging
about Grammont. When I told
Madame de Beughem of my plan to
go there to see Chantilly lace in the
making, she answered, “But that will be
a futile journey; the women have had
practically no black or white silk thread
since the war, and the few who were
still working in 1914 will have stopt; that
one-time important branch of the industry
has almost ceased to exist.” I decided,
however, to visit the tomb of
Chantilly, the lace so closely identified
with Grammont that in Belgium it takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
its name from that city, rather than from
its original French home.</p>

<p>And Grammont itself, a town of 13,000
inhabitants, was well worth the journey,
situated as it is in a lovely region of rolling
hills, and deriving its name from
the steep slope (Grand Mont) to which
part of the city clings. The surrounding
undulating country is dotted with quaint,
clustered villages, some with thatched,
some with tiled roofs, and only twenty
miles away is the charming town of
Audenarde&mdash;poor Audenarde, so cruelly
wounded by the war!</p>

<p>I reached Grammont about noon, having
lost an hour on the way through the
difficulty of passing camions and artillery
and marching companies of Canadian soldiers.
Between Ninove and Grammont,
too, were many squads of German prisoners
at work on the ruined road. They
were guarded by the French, but it was
a rather lenient surveillance, at any rate
the sullen groups in their trailing gray
capes appeared to be casually tapping the
mud with their spades instead of being
genuinely at work.</p>

<p>My Belgian chauffeur, whose health is
broken after three years of forced labor
in Germany, would have been delighted
to run them down, and at one point did
succeed in splashing a group with mud,
as he called “Boches” and something I
did not catch. I began to understand the
ruling that released Belgian prisoners
shall not be placed over Germans still
held here.</p>

<p>After lunch I started with Madame
Cuseners to the little lace school whose
director has courageously carried on during
the four years. We walked through
a narrow arched passageway beside a
brick building and into a large hall at the
rear which was at one time the lace class-room.
Instead of lace-workers, however,
we found Scotch and Canadian soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>busy tacking the Union Jack and Belgian
flags on the wall, and hanging boughs
and festoons of colored paper rings&mdash;they
were making ready for a “grand”
New Year’s Eve dancing party. In the
courtyard still farther back a half-dozen
Scotchmen had built a campfire, protecting
it with a low canvas roof, and it was
burning brightly despite the dismal rain.</p>

<p>It shone on the windows of the long,
narrow room at the side of the court,
which looked like a conservatory, but
which had become the refuge of the lace-workers,
when because of lack of thread
and fuel, they could no longer occupy
their hall. I found fifty sweet-faced girls
between thirteen and fifteen busy over
their cushions, a faithful, tired-looking
old Abb&eacute; and an enthusiastic young
woman teacher. They were not making
black nor the less important white silk
Chantilly, for they had long been entirely
without silk thread. Nevertheless, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>were preserving the art of making it,
since they had been kept at work on
Chantilly designs executed with bobbins
and the white cotton thread furnished by
the Committee. They had some fine
flounces, which were not, however, to be
compared with the traditional black silk
ones of the great Chantilly days.</p>

<p>For Chantilly has seen great days. It
appeared first in France about 1740,
where it achieved a phenomenal popularity,
which was unfortunately rudely ended
by the Revolution, for since it was a
favorite lace at court, the Revolutionists
made it a crime to appear in Chantilly.
Later, under the Empire, it enjoyed a revival,
the fabrication of the silk laces
spread in France; Bayeux became a celebrated
center; and, finally, toward 1835,
it crossed to Belgium, where Grammont
was early recognized as its home. In
1851 all of the forty-nine schools of that
province taught the technique of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>lace. Then toward 1870 true Chantilly
seemed doomed a second time to extinction
by the success of the machine imitations
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pierre des Calais, and also
because the vogue for black lace had
passed. But again the pendulum has
swung back; the imitations are now
greatly in favor and there is a cheering
increase in the demand for the true lace
flounces.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; brought out from dusty
drawers the school’s stock of designs,
elegant groupings of bouquets and
foliage, with occasional striking geometrical
details introduced, all joined by
a fine hexagonal mesh, which resembled
at first that of Malines, and later, more
closely, the Point d’ Alen&ccedil;on mesh. The
fact that this lace is often used for scarfs
and gowns, and that the customary
flounce is of generous width, has encouraged
the development of elaborate
patterns. Some of the sketches were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>divided by heavy pencil lines into the
separate narrow strips on which the lace-maker
actually works. To achieve the
wide flounce, these strips are attached
one to another by special workers who
employ a joining stitch that defies detection.
The individual pattern strips include
both mesh and flowers and follow
irregular lines, curving, it may be, to include
a full-petaled rose. When one examines
the fineness of the clear hexagonal
mesh that forms the base of Chantilly, it
seems all the more remarkable that the
division lines are not visible. This Chantilly
mesh has differed during various
periods and besides there are always almost
as many varieties as there are
workers, for one weaves more closely or
more firmly than another. I came soon
to realize how great a difference in effect
results from a practically invisible variation
in the thickness of the thread, or in
the manner of twisting or looping it or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>in the placing of the pins. One of the
distinguishing characteristics of Chantilly
is the relief produced by a heavier thread
that outlines the pattern and forms the
twigs and veins of the leaves. In securing
a brilliant relief, the French have
always succeeded better than the Belgians.</p>

<p>These Grammont pupils were also making
Blonde, a favorite lace with the
Spanish people, and introduced into Belgium
from France at the same time as
Chantilly. Its processes are very similar,
tho it is easily differentiated from its
sister by the heavy glossy petals of its
flowers and their conspicuous open-work
centers in the Point de Paris stitch. The
name Blonde is derived from the &eacute;cru
silk which was first employed in its making;
now it is made of white or of black
silk, and chiefly in the form of scarfs or
mantillas. The girls were making their
war-time Blonde of cotton, the good Peat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>cotton of Nottingham, brought in by the
C. R. B. for the Lace Committee. It is
practically only in the Grammont and
Turnhout regions that Blonde is still
made.</p>

<p>The instructress showed me the little
bundles of poor, crooked brass pins that
were all that remained after four years
of the occupation, explaining what harm
poor pins can work in a fine mesh like
that of Chantilly. Then she asked if I
could not tell them when they might expect
new ones. Alas, these disheartening
months of the winter of 1918–1919 when
one hope after another has been deferred;
so many things to be done at once, and
all depending on the re-establishment of
a system of transportation utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>I went from the school-room, past the
fire in the courtyard, back to the large hall
where the Canadians were still decorating
for their party, and where we wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>one another a Happy New Year&mdash;brave
Canadian boys well loved by the Belgians&mdash;then
on to the house of Madame’s
mother, who for a half-century has been
a lace <i>fabricant</i>, or dealer, and whose
front room served easily as combined
salon and office. Precious laces need very
little space; they can be stored in a handsome
carved oak armoire, which is at
once a safe and a beautiful article of
furniture. This old lady’s hair was still
dark and glossy, as is so often the case
with grandmothers in Europe, and her
brown eyes were bright and keen. She
talked of the time when there were more
than twenty dealers employing over 2,000
workers on Chantilly in the Grammont
region, and of the gradual decline of the
industry. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>“Certain empty houses on the
heights above the town tell the story.
Long ago the lace-makers left the valley
at the foot of the slope, and seeking the
brighter light on the hill, formed a lace
colony there; but they have come down
again, the houses on the hill are deserted.
One by one the skilled old workers have
died, and their secrets with them. There
is only one really excellent <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</span> left
and she is a baker-woman who exercises
her talent of pricking patterns between
baking! And I believe that instead of
the former thousands, we have not more
than eight hundred <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span> to-day.
Here, as elsewhere, factories have come,
and the lace has fled. With us it is the
cigar and the match that have banished
it, they furnish better wages and our
women follow. However, if we can win
a higher pay for the lace, and can but
develop the little school you have just
visited, and continue to train our girls,
we shall yet be able to restore Chantilly.
Especially,” she added, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>“if we can be
helped by that fickle Mistress Fashion,
who last year smiled again on the black
lace gown. Some of our patterns for
robes can be made in a few weeks, but
the truly fine ones take months, even a
year to make. All depends on the design
and the number of threads. We have had
much to combat in the success of the
marvelous Calais machine imitations of
Chantilly, but true lovers of lace will
never be content with them, however
clever they are.”</p>

<p>She shook out a folded triangular
shawl. “There is no lace in the world
more beautiful than this,” she said, as
she spread it on the white tablecloth, the
better to display the wealth of its black
flower clusters and long fronds, and then
had me squeeze the delicate mesh in my
hand to test its resiliency. I could not
but agree with her. Her daughter
brought out an exquisite collar, a tendril
and flower pattern, with long tabs that
could be crossed in front and let fall
like a sash behind, a “Marie Antoinette”
of most tempting loveliness; then a dainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>parasol and a fan and a few filmy winged
butterflies&mdash;all pieces made before the
war, before the Germans set a wall of
fire between the women of Grammont and
the silk thread (Grenadine d’Alays)
which meant their bread.</p>

<p>I was glad to have a few hours of
sweeping hill country between these elegant
black laces and the Valenciennes I
was next to see; for the moment all white
lace seemed negligible.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">After</span> a day beside the graves of
Nieuport and Dixmude and Ypres,
the first glimpse of the singing towers
of Bruges against the evening sky
seems an unearthly vision. During four
years no one had known that Bruges
would not perish as her sisters had perished.
One must have come direct from
the desolation of Nieuport, to her pignons
and bridges, from the skeleton of Les
Halles of Ypres to her H&ocirc;tel de Ville,
to estimate her incomparable beauty.
Since Ypres is dead, only Bruges and
Turnhout remain as true lace cities of
Belgium; Ghent, the elegant neighbor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Bruges, and herself once a Queen in the
lace world, has turned to her factories
and no longer counts. Except Turnhout,
then, with its famous schools for fine
laces, no Belgian city to-day challenges
the leadership of Bruges, and beyond
Belgium, she has but one great rival&mdash;Venice.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">LACE-MAKERS OF BRUGES</p>
</div>

<p>This claim to leadership rests on a
solid foundation. Bruges is of ancient
lineage in the lace world; she has preserved
unbroken, through at least four
centuries, the traditions of that world.
There are those even who believe that
mediæval bobbin lace had its origin in
her territory, and they are at least supported
by legend. A pretty story tells
of a poor and infirm widow, who with
her many children lived in a little street
of Bruges. The entire family depended
only on the work of Serena, the eldest,
who from dawn till dark turned her
wheel. She had long been loved by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>neighbor, Arnold, the son of a great merchant,
and she did not view him with disfavor.
But as winter and misery settled
again on the poor little hut, and Serena
saw that all her efforts appeared vain,
she vowed to the Virgin never to marry
unless her family could be rescued from
their suffering. Then one day when near
the Minnewater, as she was making sad
thoughts, suddenly she saw a light, and
from the Virgin threads descended
toward her, which, skipping the branches,
dropt in her lap, where they by chance
designed lovely patterns. Serena understood
this to be the response to her
prayer, and she tried at once to reproduce
the arabesques in linen thread. She
ended by attaching little woods to them
and by aiding them with pins. And thus
to the great emotion of Bruges bobbin-lace
was born. And all the rich seigneurs
and bourgeois wished to possess it.
Ease came and Serena married Arnold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>and they had many daughters, all of
whom she taught to make lace.</p>

<p>The often quoted picture in the Louvre
Gallery, painted by Hans Memling (14&mdash; to 1494)
and representing the Virgin and
the Infant Christ surrounded by gift-bearers,
among whom is a rich Brugeois
wearing a gray costume trimmed with a
bobbin-lace edging, certainly indicates
that the industry existed in this epoch,
and possibly had its center at Bruges,
then the principal city in Flanders and
the seat of the court. Furthermore,
records prove that already at the opening
of the <abbr title="sixteenth">16th</abbr> century, lace-making was
included as a necessary part of the education
of women. The edicts of Charles
<abbr title="5">V</abbr> requiring that it should be taught in
all the schools and convents, greatly stimulated
its development in Bruges, as well
as throughout the entire Flanders and the
provinces of Hainaut, Brabant and Antwerp.
It became so popular an occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
for women that Charles’s successor,
Philip <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, required that the magistrates
of Ghent and Bruges restrict the number
of lace-workers in their cities, in order
that the rich might find some women left
willing to serve them. Another enlightening
document shows that in 1544 Bruges
counted 7,696 poor among her population,
and that the department of public charity
required of the young women among
them that they should cease to walk the
streets and should learn the lace industry.
There were at that time many lace
schools. During the following centuries,
Bruges maintained her position as a lace
center and was able to survive the death-blow
the French Revolution dealt the industry.
For we find, about the middle of
the <abbr title="nineteenth">19th</abbr> century, the city still counted
seventy-nine schools, attended by 2,722
pupils, while in Valenciennes, for example,
lace-making no longer existed.</p>

<p>There is, then, a rich and ancient past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>back of the clicking bobbins of the Bruges
of to-day. After four years of German
rule it is still difficult to give accurate
statistics, but generally speaking, in this
city of 54,000 inhabitants, as many as
5,000 women and girls make lace of some
sort. If you question the average woman,
she will probably look at you in surprize
and say: “How many lace-makers? Why,
everybody; there is hardly a house in
Bruges without its cushion and bobbins.”
While if you put the same question to
such a celebrated lace dealer as M. Gillemont
de Cock, who counts gold and silver
medals from many nations, he will be
very apt to answer: “Madame, before
the war I knew of about thirty, now I
can not say!” The Lace Committee at
Brussels considers 5,000 a fair estimate
for Bruges and her contributing villages,
which is the number given, too, by Professor
Maertens of the Normal School.</p>

<p>By the Bruges district is meant chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Bruges, quite the contrary of the usual
situation. One hears of the Alost region,
for instance, and finds that while the
villages of the surrounding area count
thousands of workers, in the city of Alost
itself very few are left. However,
Bruges, too, counts some few outlying
villages. Madame Ryeland, representative
during the war of the Brussels Lace
Committee, told me that forty communes
contributed to her committee, the most
important being Syssele (where Valenciennes
is the favorite lace), Maldeghem
(applications and filet), Saint Andre
(Cluny and Valenciennes), Oostcamp and
Lophem (Valenciennes), Saint Croix
(Cluny and other guipures), and Saint
Michele (an unusually beautiful Duchesse
de Bruges).</p>

<p>In Bruges itself there are three important
convent lace schools, working
largely for the shops, but which also execute
private commands; the convent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>school of the Apostolines, typical of those
where the children learn a little Flemish,
a little French, much catechism, and for
the rest make the laces of the region from
morning till evening; the school Defoere,
and the well-known school Josephine.
Each has between 100 and 200 <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span>,
who make the popular Torchons
and Clunys and Valenciennes, and also
the more difficult Binche, with its mesh
characterized by the airy “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boules de
neige</i>,” snow-balls. They make, too, Old
Flanders, which has a particularly strong
and elaborate mesh; and of course the
Duchesse de Bruges, or Bruges, for which
the city is famous. In addition to the
convent schools and a few other less important
laique schools and some work-rooms,
one finds in the Hospices, or free
homes for the old, another goodly company
working together. In their picturesque
retreats some 200 old women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>pass their days making lace, chiefly
Valenciennes.</p>

<p>There remain the individual households;
to the common statement that in
each one, some member makes some kind
of lace, one might add, at some time during
the year. If the children from these
homes do not go to the schools to learn,
they are taught by their mothers and
grandmothers. A favorite Christmas
gift to children is a cushion and set of
bobbins, with which they soon learn to
produce simple patterns. For example,
Madame Roose, the daughter of the concierge
of the Groothuis Museum, which
houses the marvelous Baron Liedts collection
of old laces, accustomed from
childhood to see and hear of these laces,
became herself a lace-maker and later a
successful dealer and now has five daughters
of her own, all of whom she has herself
taught to ply their bobbins. The
Lace Committee told me that during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>war the clothing committee had difficulty
in finding young girls and women who
could darn and sew even moderately well;
since childhood they had given all their
time to lace-making. Conscious of the
danger in this situation, the Lace Normal
School preaches that until she has learned
other necessary things, no young girl
should be allowed to spend more than
half a day over her cushion.</p>

<p class="small">Symbolic color pattern on left-hand easel; demonstration

<p>By far the greater number working at
home make Torchon, Cluny and Valenciennes,
tho the Bruges district is celebrated,
too, for Rosaline and Binche and
Old Flanders, and above all for the
Duchesse de Bruges, once so named because
it was thought worthy to adorn a
Duchess. Bruges lace has always been
made entirely with bobbins, in separate
flowers, or details that are united not
by mesh, but by little picot-edged cords
or bars. There are many varieties
of this familiar lace; between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>coarse, much marketed modern Bruges,
with its well-known roses and trefoils,
sometimes scarcely meriting the name of
lace, and the Bruges of the robe presented
in 1901 to Queen Elizabeth, then the
Princess Elizabeth, there is a deplorable
distance. The individual trefoils and
arabesques and roses of the coarser kinds
are made very quickly on the round
cushion, which can be readily turned, and
are produced in great quantities in many
of the communes of the Bruges region,
while fortunately in such a village as
Saint Michel one can still see exquisite
examples of the finer Bruges in the making.</p>

</div>

<p>Rather than be introduced to the lace-making
of Bruges by the younger
workers in the schools, or in one of the
thousand homes given over to it, I preferred
to go first to the place where probably
more strangers, especially English
and Americans, have been initiated into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>the mysteries of the cushion and its
bobbins than anywhere else in the world.
There have been other famous B&eacute;guinages
in Belgium&mdash;congeries of houses maintained
by private endowment, for women,
who, while they object to taking the vows
of the convent, yet wish to live in a
kind of partial retreat from the world
and under the protection of the church&mdash;but
none lovelier than this one of Bruges,
with its sixteenth century buildings of
pure Flemish architecture, grouped about
a wide green court shaded by elm trees.
Naturally the B&eacute;guinage has not been a
mecca for travelers and artists merely
because several of the gentle old ladies
in retreat there made beautiful lace; they
have come in search of its quaint pignons
and doorways, its inner gardens, the
bridges that span the surrounding canals
where the swans paddle peacefully. And
they have been delighted to find included
in the picture the white-capped women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>before their lace cushions, intent (doubtless
unconsciously) on perpetuating other
beauties, as old as those of the buildings
encircling the court, the designs of
Valenciennes that have been handed down
by French and Belgian mothers to their
children through generations. These
ladies of the B&eacute;guinage may keep their
private fortunes and pay for the privileges
of the retreat. They are supposed, however,
to live austerely; their charming
brick houses are white inside&mdash;wall-papers
(as being too gay) are forbidden&mdash;while
the floors are covered with a kind of
pretty, rude rush carpet. They may not
go on journeys, and no man outside, except
the clergy, may enter the sacred precincts
of the court, the gates of which are
closed at 8 o’clock. Can one imagine an
atmosphere more encouraging to hours
spent patiently in lace-making? It is recorded
that in the B&eacute;guinage of Ghent,
in 1756, there were as many as 5,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>women engaged in making the Valenciennes
for which that city was famous.
But the day of this particular kind of retreat
has passed, and even at Bruges many
of the houses are vacant; when the old die,
there are few who wish to take their
places. And it is only because those few
who remain preserve the best traditions
of the lace that they count in the lace-world
of to-day; the quantity produced
is negligible. Nevertheless, I was delighted
that my first knowledge of Bruges
lace should come through the few wide
Valenciennes flounces of exquisite flower
and vine pattern and firm and even workmanship
that I found still pinned to the
cushions of the B&eacute;guinage.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, in this retreat, pervaded
by the sadness that inevitably reigns
where the old order changes, I found the
young and enthusiastic Vicaire, Professor
Maertens, assistant director of the new
Lace Normal School of Bruges. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>lives with his aunt, who is the mother
director of the B&eacute;guinage and called
“Madame, la Grande Dame,” tho she is
still Mademoiselle. The B&eacute;guinage may
in one sense represent the despair of the
lace, since what is happening there is
happening throughout Belgium. But in
the person of Professor Maertens of the
Normal School, the B&eacute;guinage represents,
too, the hope of the lace. In the plain
little room of his charming Gothic house,
he explained with admirable clarity the
necessity which led to the founding of
this Normal School by the State in 1911,
and the system which it has developed.
He then arranged that I should “assist”
at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">r&eacute;ouverture</i> of the school the
following morning. There was to be a
reopening because, in common with so
many schools of Belgium, the Lace
Normal had been driven from its quarters
by the Germans, and tho after their
eviction the teachers had persisted in continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
their classes in a convent, where
their persecutors forced them to receive
two Austrian pupils (from whom, however,
they concealed much), they were in
the true sense to begin again on January
7, 1919. That was fully four weeks
after the invader had had to evacuate, for
eager as they were to commence, with
their best effort, they had not been able
before this to prepare three school-rooms
and a few smaller ones on the ground
floor for use. We are accustomed to the
pictures of the territories desolated by
the Germans, but unless one goes from
house to house in the districts supposed to
be left unharmed, he can have no conception
of the state in which they were left.
However, by Thursday morning the few
rooms on the ground floor had been disinfected
and whitewashed, and the Lace
Normal School of Belgium re-opened its
doors at 8:30 o’clock. Poets have described
the shining faces of children on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>their way to school&mdash;but after pupils and
teachers have been ground under the
heel of an implacable oppressor for four
years there is still another light in their
faces as they reassemble in a free school-room.
It was generous of them to allow
me to share their first morning.</p>

<p>The teachers’ course covers two years.
In order to insure careful individual
training the directors prefer to have no
more than eight or ten earnest students
in each year’s class; they prefer, too, that
these shall not have been lace-makers
before entering, and that they be between
sixteen and thirty years of age.
There are, then, two class-rooms, light
and airy, and equipped with blackboards
and charts, and the all-important large
demonstration cushion with its gigantesque
bobbins attached to heavy colored
wool threads to aid the eye and brain.
Each young woman records the steps of
her progress in a series of copy-books so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>beautiful in their penmanship and their
drawing as to recall at once the manuscripts
of long ago.</p>

<p>What, then, is the instruction which
they receive? Since there had never been
a system of teaching lace-making in Belgium,
the directors of the Normal School
were obliged to develop one, and as it
exists to-day, logical, comprehensive, far-seeing,
it belongs exclusively to the
School of Bruges. By the defective
method employed before, a pupil was
taught to make one kind of lace, then
another, and another, but tho she might
become proficient in the execution of
thirty kinds, she might still be incapable
of executing a new thirty-first variety if
it were presented to her, because she had
not been taught the underlying principles.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">DETAILS FOR BRUGES LACE</p>

<p class="small">Made with bobbins on round cushion</p>
</div>

<p>The Bruges directors found, after a
long and careful analysis of the processes
employed in all known laces, that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>depend on but between twenty and thirty
major operations, and that, in the final
analysis, for the bobbin laces, these reduce
themselves always to the simple
question, “Does the thread pass from
left to right, or does it pass from right
to left?”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i_161.jpg" id="i_161.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_161.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="550" />
<p class="captioncenter">DOILY SET IN POINT DE PARIS IN THE “ANIMALS OF THE ALLIES”
DESIGN, EXECUTED AT TURNHOUT</p>
</div>

<p>They chose specific colors, red, purple,
green and others, to represent specific
movements of the threads, thus establishing
a symbolic color system of design
which enables the pupil to read a blackboard
drawing as he would a written
page. And they realized that before the
processes are portrayed by lines on the
blackboard, they should be executed with
the gigantesque bobbins and the colored
wool cords.</p>

<p>They then outlined the two years’ work,
which they made to include classes in
practical lace-making, in design, in commerce
and English, in the history of lace-making,
and religion. Because the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>years’ course was already over-crowded
they did not attempt to teach the needle
points, which, according to them, do not
demand a system of instruction in the
same sense that the bobbin laces require
it. Besides, they look upon bobbin lace
as more uniquely Belgian and as therefore
more necessary to develop. Dr.
Rubbens of Zele, farther east, plans soon
to have a needle lace Normal School in
operation in that town.</p>

<p>In the first year class, a demonstration
of the use of the tools, the winding-wheel,
the cushion and bobbins is followed at
once by the study of the Torchons, which
tho they are the commonest known laces,
yet in all their varieties employ all the
more important lace processes. The
Torchons once thoroughly mastered, the
student has traveled a considerable distance
on the lace journey. The study of
Torchon is succeeded by Cluny in all
its varieties and Cluny is in turn followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>by a kind of barbaric Russian lace, of
baroque design, which is, like the Torchons
and Clunys, made of linen thread,
and resembles them closely in other ways.
The finer laces, Valenciennes, Duchesse,
Flanders, and others are taught only
after these first three groups have been
mastered.</p>

<p>Along with the actual lace-making, the
students follow courses in design, where
they begin first with simple studies in
geometry and in drawing. They then execute
geometric designs and adapt them to
lace-making. From these studies they
proceed to drawing from nature, and to
what is more difficult, the adaption of the
drawings from nature to lace designs, for
it is one thing to create a beautiful flower
and leaf arabesque, and quite another
thing to draw it so that it may be exprest
in thread.</p>

<p>The important classes in commerce and
English and those in history and religion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>run parallel with the studies in lace-making
and design.</p>

<p>Of great value to these future teachers
of Belgium is the model practise school
across the court from the main rooms,
where at four o’clock each day the poorer
children of the neighborhood come to be
taught. Each has her cushion and bobbins
and pins and thread furnished by the
Normal, and enjoys all the advantages
offered by its excellent system; while the
coming teachers find here the opportunity
to perfect their methods.</p>

<p>I asked if these teachers could look
confidently to finding positions. Since
only the initial class had graduated before
the Germans were upon Belgium and
since that class was composed almost entirely
of women sent from the already
existing convent schools, who sought to
improve their methods, it is as yet impossible
to answer this question. But as
this is the single training-school in Belgium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
(the Brussels School, so capably
directed by <abbr title="Madam">Mme.</abbr> Paulis, being chiefly a
school of design) there seems to be every
reason to hope that once the country has
risen from the chaos into which it has
been plunged, the Bruges graduates will
have no difficulty in securing places.
Teachers are as yet very poorly paid, but
as regards salaries, too, there is reason
to hope. The ideal plan for a school
would seem to be that it should be in
charge of a graduate of the Normal
School, while a specialist in design from
the Brussels school should come once a
week with her charts and drawings to
give particular instruction in that branch.
The vital decision as to the part lace-making
should have in the curriculum of
the communal or free public schools is
still in abeyance.</p>

<p>Since factories have killed the lace industry
in every other city in Belgium except
Bruges and Turnhout, people often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>ask if it can persist much longer in
Bruges. There seems to be good ground
to believe it will. Under the Germans
the port of Zeebrugge acquired a momentary
prominence, but with Antwerp so
near, there seems little chance that it
will ever become important, or that
Bruges herself may look forward to any
large industrial development. Lovely,
tranquil city guarding a beauty of long
ago, it is probable that Bruges will maintain
her right to the title “Queen of Lace
Cities.” “Yes,” M. Gillemont de Cock
would add, seeing the patterns and quality
of the Valenciennes and the modern
Old Flanders and Bruges, and Binche,
pinned to her cushions to-day, and remembering
the exquisite delicate webs of
a few decades ago, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une Reine, Madame,
c’est vrai, mais une Reine bien malade</i>”&mdash;“a
Queen, Madame, it is true, but a
very sick Queen.” The Lace Normal and
other schools can help greatly to restore
her.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> a wet, cheerless day between
Christmas and New Year’s, I
started with Madame de Beughem
and Madame Allard for the most important
lace district of Eastern Flanders.
The Alost region, which in 1896 counted
8,500 workers, is known throughout the
lace world for its Needle Point and
Venise.</p>

<p>We went first to Alost itself, the center
of the area, where, however, modern industries
have won their already oft-repeated
victory over the lace. It was in
Alost, the <abbr title="sixteenth">16th</abbr> of November, 1918, that
my car had scarcely been able to push its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>way between the two lines of Belgian soldiers
of deliverance holding back the
smiling, tearful population, and where,
too, I passed Burgomaster Max free after
four years in prison in Germany, on his
way to King Albert at the Army Headquarters
near Ghent.</p>

<p>A short distance south of Alost we
passed Haltaert, from which this lace section
might more justly take its name,
since in Haltaert there is scarcely a
household without its needle or bobbin
workers. And but a little farther south
lay Kerxken, which even in the rain,
looked a friendly village and where beside
fully three-fourths of the windows
women were plying their needles.</p>

<p>Before the war companies of the men
of this region went to France to work in
the harvest, as many as 40,000 migrating
annually, because even before the war,
France was short-handed agriculturally
and the French fields offered higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>wages than their own. The women
and girls helped those who remained to
gather the crops, and in the fall, when
the men came back and the season for
working the farms had passed, whole
families turned to lace-making as a
means of piecing out the gains of the
summer. Sometimes the men cared for
the children or assisted with the housework
so that the women might sit uninterruptedly
before their patterns, and
in certain instances they themselves made
lace&mdash;the census of 1896 lists 117 men
lace-workers in Belgium. In Kerxken
we found that thirty young men who
had been silk weavers before the war had
during the occupation been able to make
lace&mdash;not true lace, but such imitations
as filet, really a form of embroidery.
They made, too, Application, not genuine
Application where true lace details, made
either with the bobbin or needle, are
sewed upon the tulle base, but tulle ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with machine-made lacets, narrow
braids of various sorts that come to the
region from Calais. Lacets usually have
a strong thread along one edge, which
can be drawn so that the braid may be
more swiftly fashioned into curving
leaves or flowers. These distressing
imitations, which unfortunately pay
much better than the true laces, since
they can be made with great speed and
find a ready market, are a constant
menace to them. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voil&agrave; notre ennemie!</i>”
said Madame Allard, as we looked into
a work-room where the table showed little
piles of lacet collars. The only method
of fighting this enemy is through higher
wages for the genuine lace.</p>

<p>We could not see Adele Rulant, once
with hardly a peer in Needle Point, to
whom people from far and near had sent
their old pieces, even shreds of their
family treasure, for restoration, knowing
that almost certainly her artist’s needle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>would recapture the lost mesh or flower.
Adele Rulant had died and we realized
again how surely one by one the famous
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span> of the last half of the <abbr title="nineteenth">19th</abbr>
century are dropping out.</p>

<p>We turned down a lane and were soon
at the green door of the convent of the
black-robed Franciscaine Sisters, who
dismayed, but smiling, hurried forward
to greet us, very fresh looking in their
white lined coiffes and collars. I say dismayed,
because through an error they
had expected us the day before and had
kept a fire burning for hours, a supreme
expression of hospitality in this bitter,
coalless winter; this was Saturday afternoon,
there was no fire, and the lace-workers
were at home scrubbing their
tiled floors and doorsteps. But they
would light a fire at once, and send a
Sister to the nearest houses to recall at
least a few of the women; they would
prepare lunch for us, a plate of little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>cakes and a bottle of wine had already
been set on the table. Such an apologetic
bustle of welcome was heart-warming on
a cheerless day. Nothing less, I am certain,
would have made it possible for me
to drink an entire glass of sour red wine
at 10:30 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>I wished particularly to visit the convent
because I had known during the
four years of S&oelig;ur Robertine’s successive
victories over the Germans. After
they refused to let laces pass except
through their hands, which taxed and
had frequently stolen from the parcels,
time and again she outwitted them,
crossing the forbidden village frontier
and carrying the precious rolls herself to
the office of the Committee at Brussels.</p>

<p>Beneath the calm of that office there
was always tense expectancy; at any moment
anything might happen, even the
worst thing. One day after weeks of
being entirely cut off from many of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>lace sections, when the women were more
strained and anxious than ever before,
the door opened quietly and S&oelig;ur
Robertine, of Kerxken, a prohibited district,
stood before them. Fear for her
quite overcame their joy at seeing her;
they quickly turned the key and hurried
her into a rear room. “But why have
you come? We did not send for you&mdash;we
should never have allowed you to take
such risks!”</p>

<p>At first only S&oelig;ur Robertine’s twinkling,
keen gray eyes answered, as she
slowly threw off her long black cape and
from beneath other garments began unwinding
meter upon meter of lovely white
lace, till the billowy lengths covered all
the table. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>“It was very simple&mdash;I had to
come. For weeks our thread has been
exhausted; the women are suffering for
need of their earnings. I found a way,
and I’ll find a way back, never fear; we’ll
all return safely to Kerxken&mdash;the thread
and the money and I&mdash;even tho we may
have to slip in under the very nose of
the Boche!” She was still laughing and
still producing lace, little packets now of
square insets and bouquets, when I had
to leave.</p>

<p>It was a delight to meet her again here
freely directing her convent&mdash;she who
had so bravely held her right to freedom.
Her parents had been shop-keepers and
she had brought to the Order a goodly
store of practical knowledge and a general
alertness and good sense, which
added to her unselfishness and swift
sympathy and ever-ready laugh, easily
explained the admiration and affection
generally felt for her.</p>

<p>While we were sitting in the large,
cold reception room, waiting for the
workers to reassemble, I asked S&oelig;ur
Robertine about a painting over the door&mdash;a
striking portrait which proved to be
that of the Cur&eacute; Van Hoeimessen, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>in 1857, founded the convent in an attempt
to relieve the misery of the village.
A short time before this, greatly distrest
by the idleness and poverty of his parishioners,
he had asked that a teacher be
sent to Kerxken to instruct a few girls
in the art of lace-making, and since there
was no building in which to start a school,
he called the class of five or six girls together
in his own house. Then, later, as
the experiment succeeded, he invited a
group of sisters to come and founded for
them the convent of the Franciscaines,
which from that day has held unswervingly
to the traditions of its foundation
in teaching and executing the fine needle
laces. There are at present 15 sisters,
and about 150 true lace-workers in their
lace school. In addition, 300 makers of
filet and “imitation” are connected with
the convent.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">DETAIL SHOWING SEVEN DIFFERENT FILLING-IN STITCHES</p>
</div>

<p>From the salon we went to the work-room,
which looks on a deep walled-in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>garden, a treasure-plot for potatoes and
cabbage during the famine years. About
a dozen girls and women had dropt their
brushes and brooms and hurried through
the rain in their wooden shoes to take up
their patterns and go on with the delicate
traceries of Needle Point and Venise. It
was easy to pick out their leader&mdash;a
beautiful-faced, white-haired woman
wearing a black crochet cap, at work on
a Venise insertion. She was Sidonie, the
best <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</span>, or interpreter of design, in
the convent. There were no cushions
here, as in the bobbin-lace classes, and
the workers held the small, shining, black
cloth pattern in their hands, following the
pricked holes with their needles; there
were fewer of these guiding pin-pricks
than in the bobbin-lace picqu&eacute;s. The patterns
for Venise and Needle Point are
usually small because most women object
to large details, as difficult to turn in the
hand. Later in a neighboring convent I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>noticed that the patterns were considerably
larger than those at Kerxken, and
S&oelig;ur Robertine, pointing to them said,
“I should have to cut those in two for
my girls.” Fortunately a detail can
usually easily be separated and later rejoined.
To protect her lace, the worker
covers it with thick blue paper, cutting a
hole about the size of a twenty-five-cent
piece through which the needle and
thread may move freely. Here it was
not the marvel of the flying fingers, as in
the bobbin-rooms at Turnhout, that most
won our admiration, but the skill in directing
the fine threads in complicated designs
of incredible delicacy. I chose to
sit beside fifteen-year-old Colette who
held the partly finished section of a handkerchief
square beneath her needle. She
explained that it was Point de Gaze,
gauze point, a name more recently given
the old Needle or Brussels Point. And
the fragile hexagonal mesh she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>weaving between two beautiful full-blown
roses, whose raised petals curved outward
from elaborately worked centers, seemed
most appropriately named. Her cotton,
for Needle Point is made with cotton
thread, was so fine that I could not,
despite her amused reiterations, believe
it did not break with every second stitch.
A heavier thread had been used to make
the flat, closely woven portions of the
flowers, and a still heavier one to outline
each finished petal or leaf with the <i>cordonnet</i>
(cord) or <i>brode</i>, produced by an
extremely firm and regular buttonhole
stitch. This cord throws the flowers into
very brilliant relief.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">VENISE DESIGNS BY THE BRUSSELS LACE COMMITTEE</p>
</div>

<p>Colette had not woven the roses, for
because of the difficulty in making it,
workers usually specialize on the various
individual parts composing this extremely
popular lace. A second girl had made
the flowers, and a third the exquisite
open-work details introduced to lighten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>the whole. Considerable freedom is allowed
the lace-worker in the execution
of these open-work stitches. If she has
talent she may obtain many interesting
original results in filling in, for there is
apparently no limit to the number of
stitches she may employ. In Colette’s
little handkerchief square, I discovered
miniature marguerites and stars and airy
balls. Each group had been made by a
specialist (many women have spent their
lives in making just tiny stars or wheels),
and sent to the convent to be bound together
with the leaves and roses into a
beautiful whole by the clear mesh that
dropt hexagon by hexagon from Colette’s
swift needle.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">HANDKERCHIEF AND JEWEL BOXES, FLANDERS AND VENISE OVER

</div>

<p>Colette’s neighbor was making the
same mesh, but as a background for
bobbin-made clusters, sent here from a
bobbin-lace village to make the rare
Point d’Angleterre, a small quantity of
which Kerxken still produces.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>In the corner of this class-room were
the shelves with the essential skeins of
thread; cotton for the Needle Point, linen
for the Venise. The linen is more and
more difficult to obtain, and since it is
hard to handle and breaks easily, has been
largely supplanted by cotton thread.
There were large cardboard boxes for
the drawings and the pricked working
patterns; others for the little bobbin-lace
roses and leaves and vines that were to be
worked into Brussels Point; and still
more boxes for the finished meters and
insets ready to be sold to the Committee,
and later to the dealer who will replace
the Committee. While we were examining
the boxes a pretty, dark-haired
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;re</span> of about sixteen came in, with
work she had finished at home, two handkerchiefs
with Brussels Point borders,
and two and a half meters of Venise, on
which she had worked five and a half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>months and for which she asked 160
francs, or $40.00.</p>

<p>In the “imitation” room we passed
quickly by the lengths of inferior filet
and the piles of cheap collars made by
men; there was little temptation to linger
there. The only defense against that
room is more pay for the work across the
hall.</p>

<p>We climbed the stairs shivering and
looked into the neat little bedrooms with
their white board floors, and into the icy
chapel where S&oelig;ur Robertine declared
she could be quite comfortable with only
a small black woolen shawl over her
shoulders.</p>

<p>We had brought our lunch, but were
not allowed to eat it. Sister A., an excellent
cook, had prepared hot soup,
potatoes and meat, and a dried apple
mousse which we persuaded S&oelig;ur
Robertine to share with us. And after
lunch, the orphan and refugee children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>came in to shake hands, also Janiken, the
poor “<i>idiote</i>” who is forty-nine years old,
but still a child, with a strange, animal-like
expression on her face. S&oelig;ur
Robertine held her hand for us to shake,
otherwise little Janiken seemed able to direct
her own movements. She smiled
and chatted in Flemish, then waddled off
quite happy with the candies and cakes
we had brought. Janiken spends her
days making bead collars and bracelets
for the sisters, whom she loves, and when
her bead boxes are empty she places them
at the foot of the statue at the end of the
narrow corridor upstairs, and prays the
good Saint Anthony to refill them, that
she may weave more necklaces. At night
as the sisters pass silently by the statue,
they snap the threads of their former
gifts, letting the beads shower into the
boxes, and in the morning Janiken is
happy again.</p>

<p>S&oelig;ur Robertine had never ridden in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>a motor, and when we proposed that she
accompany us to the Franciscaine convent
at Erembodeghem, not very far
away, her eyes shone. And I shall not
forget the faces of the others, as after a
further bustle of leave-takings and good
wishes, they leaned from the green doorway
in the rain, clasping their hands and
laughing and nodding, while we tucked
their beloved sister into our car. S&oelig;ur
Robertine herself sat silently and ecstatically
in a corner, determined to miss
no part of this extraordinary experience.</p>

<small><i>The Queen’s Cloth</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Erembodeghem</span> is a commune
of about 6,000 inhabitants, tho the
pretty winding street by which we
entered, with the picturesque, red-tiled
houses clustered irregularly along both
sides of it, suggests a smaller village.
Nearly all the women in this town, as in
Kerxken, make lace, and again it is chiefly
Needle Point and Venise. The convent,
which furnishes the customary directing
and stimulating center, has no superior
in the country for its particular laces, unless
one grants preference to its own
mother house at Opbrakel.</p>

<p>As we entered the courtyard, a group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>of French soldiers were warming themselves
before a fire they had lighted beneath
a dripping canvas tent-roof
stretched across a corner of the wall. In
the dreary rain the fire flaming against
the brick wall, and the horizon blue of
the uniforms were a cheery greeting. But
inside the convent, alas, there was less
cheer; indeed, there was the chill of the
tomb, no coal for the poor sisters, who
were for lack of it unable to conduct the
regular school classes. They told us of
their distress over the idleness of the
children, who had been turned into the
streets by the Germans many weeks before,
and whom they were not yet able to
reassemble. “Their manners are already
so bad,” Sister A. said, “that we are
ashamed to own them as our pupils.” The
Germans left the class-rooms in the
familiar condition, and the sisters had no
sooner finished patching and disinfecting,
than the Italian soldiers were billeted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>there. They were too loyal to criticise
but I suspect that their experiences after
the departure of the Italians must have
convinced them that, after all, a new
army is just another army. The French
followed, but they at least were occupying
only four class-rooms, and the sisters
were trying to be optimistic. “We believe
they must be better,” one of them
said, with a smile; “however, we shall not
know until they are gone.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” she continued, “our lace-room
has not been requisitioned; we have
had enough coal to keep a little fire there.
During all the four years that work has
never stopt.” Since it was Saturday
afternoon there were many vacant chairs
in the class-room, but still enough girls
were present to enable us to judge of the
kind of lace school this is.</p>

<p>Little girls between nine and ten, sitting
up very straight in their high-backed
chairs, were working with swift, steady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>fingers and already producing a good
Venise insertion of a simple leaf pattern.
Several of the other girls were busy with
the now well-known Venetian Point
medallions representing the arms of the
Allied nations, and the provinces of Belgium;
still others were executing flower
details for yard lace. All this Venise they
were making with a needle and single
linen thread, for this convent works exclusively
with linen thread. They were
handling the black cloth patterns, eight to
ten inches wide, with apparent ease, turning
them with almost every stitch. This
mere mastery of the pattern is in itself
impressive.</p>

<p>In a corner, near one of the great windows
overlooking the walled-in winter
garden, a slim, darkly clad girl about sixteen
was absorbed in pricking a complicated
pattern. Sister A. led me a little
aside to explain that this was their feeble-minded
girl and that tho they could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>explain it, she was able to interpret correctly
very difficult drawings.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">VENISE BANQUET CLOTH PRESENTED BY THE LACE COMMITTEE TO H.M. QUEEN ELIZABETH ON HER RETURN FROM EXILE</p>

<p class="small">Design by M. de Rudder; executed by the 30 best Venise-makers in Belgium in six months</p>
</div>

<p>At the Committee Bureau I had seen
many of the wonderful cloths made from
Venise details from this convent (among
them the cloth typifying the burning
cities, presented to Mrs. Hoover), but I
had never imagined anything so lovely as
the exhibit the sisters had been arranging
on the long, low table, while we were
passing from chair to chair following the
magic needles.... We turned to find
the separate parts of a banquet cloth to
be offered to Queen Elizabeth on her return
from exile, assembled for us. Two
hundred and twenty details, there were, on
which during the darkest days of the war,
women had worked with unfaltering faith
and love. M. de Rudder, a well-known
Belgian artist, had drawn the design for
the Lace Committee. The border, edged
with ivy, the symbol of endurance, is composed
of ferns and wild flowers, eels and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>sea-weed, suggesting the forests and fields
and waters of Belgium. Adjoining them
are the coats of arms of destroyed cities,
bordered by a band of lilies of the valley,
signifying the return of happiness. In the
center, the four patron saints of Brussels,
Saints Michel and George, and Saints
Elizabeth and Gudule, are enwreathed
with olive branches. Saint Elizabeth,
above the Red Cross, represents the Queen
and her devoted service as nurse during
the war, while the eight medallions near
her carry the names of the Beatitudes.
Opposite Saint Elizabeth is Saint George,
who represents King Albert. Below him
is the Belgian decoration for bravery, and
in the surrounding medallions are woven
the names of battles won by him. Between
Saint Elizabeth and Saint George,
are the immortal words spoken by His
Majesty as he went from the Chamber,
sword in hand, on the <abbr title="fourth">4th</abbr> of August,
1914: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ai foi dans nos destin&eacute;es! Un
pays qui se d&eacute;fend s’impose au respect
de tous, ce pays ne p&eacute;rit pas!</i>” It is one
thing to mention a few of the two hundred
and twenty details of this glorious
cloth, it is quite another to hold any
one of them in one’s hand and realize
its perfection, its incredible combination
of softness and delicacy and firmness and
regularity. The twelve sisters gathered
happily about us, as we sat before the
table quite breathless over the discovery
of one new beauty after another in their
truly royal gift.</p>

<p>And then they brought us something
much less important, but nevertheless exquisite,
the work of Sister S., which they
show rarely, a length of Rose Point about
four inches wide, and which even the
women of the Committee after their long
years’ constant experience in lace, said
they had never seen surpassed. The linen
thread ordinarily used in Venise runs
from Number 200 to Number 300. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>lace, whose base is formed by an ethereal
interlacing of vines and tendrils, is made
with Number 2000. One can work on
it scarcely more than two or three hours
a day, and then only under the best light.
Sister S. brought me the magnifying-glass,
without which I could not have followed
the exquisitely varied points, and
lifted the infinitesimal petals of the tiny
flowers incrusting the background of interwoven
tendrils. In some of these
microscopic blooms were as many as four
layers of petals. It would be useless to
attempt to describe the loveliness that results
from the blending of the background
of vines and lifted blossoms. I asked
what a meter of such lace would bring
and learned that it will probably be sold
in Paris for 1,000 francs, tho these sisters
would be happy to guard it as one
of their convent treasures.</p>

<small><i>Mother House of a Famous Lace-making Order</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">After</span> Kerxken and Erembodeghem
I was not surprized, when inquiring
about needle laces further south,
to learn that the only school whose
work could dispute first place with
them was that of the mother house of
the same order at Opbrakel. I had come
to know that the finest needle laces of
Belgium are made in these convents of
the S&oelig;urs Franciscaines.</p>

<p>It was a bitter day, but I determined
to reach Opbrakel despite shell-pitted
roads and rain. I succeeded even in making
a short stop on the way at Cruyshautem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Convent, famous, too, for its
Needle Point, where the sisters would
have detained me longer to describe again
and again the entry of the American soldiers
at 9 o’clock in the morning on All
Saints Day&mdash;the wonderful American
soldiers who had arrived to free them
from their oppressors of four years, and
who had remained to buy every scrap of
lace in the convent, carrying away the
address with the promise to send for
more.</p>

<p>In my journeying I discovered a pretty
way of learning whose army occupied a
particular village&mdash;I looked for the first
small boy to see which soldier’s cap he
proudly wore. Thus at Opbrakel, tho it
was late afternoon when I arrived, there
were children still playing in the street,
and the boys jauntily wearing the horizontal
blue announced to me that the
French were there. These small boys,
and later the soldiers themselves, examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
my mud-splashed car with much
curiosity, as it drew up in front of the
convent door.</p>

<p>My visit was quite unannounced, but
the sisters held out their hands in welcome,
and drew me in out of the rain,
speaking, as they did so, words I had
almost forgotten, “Hot milk; you must
drink a cup of hot milk at once, Madame,
and your chauffeur also; this is a cruel
day for journeying.” They led me to a
little room, where I found another unaccustomed
comfort, a tiny fire burning
brightly. As I sat before it, sipping the
sweet milk, the first I had had since leaving
America, I remembered the gratitude
of travelers in the middle ages
toward the convents and abbeys whose
doors they found open. The war had
brought a return of many of the difficulties
and perils that beset them, with the
comfortable hostelries of pre-war days
pillaged and ruined, the little restaurants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>or caf&eacute;s that could do business filled to
overflowing with soldiers (I have spent
hours in the wind and rain at night
vainly trying to find a bed, or a place for
my car), with roads wrecked, neither
post nor telegraph, nor train, and natural
accompaniment of all this disorganization,
the necessity of being ever on guard
against thieves&mdash;in the midst of conditions
like these we can appreciate the
meaning of the cheering hospitality the
convent offers.</p>

<p>While we sat before the fire the Mother
Superior had one of the sisters show me a
treasure of the school, a framed exhibit,
illustrating in miniature all the processes
employed in the making of the needle
laces, which they had prepared for
the last International Exposition at
Brussels. Then she recounted for me a
little of the history of her lace-making
convent, which celebrates its centenary
this year, this free year of 1919. I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>imagine what it would have meant to try
to be joyful over such an anniversary
with the enemy heel still on one’s back.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago the commune
of Opbrakel was in such a wretched state
of poverty and misery that among its
2,000 inhabitants, 800 were beggars; and
as often happened elsewhere during the
period of suffering following the Napoleonic
wars, the cur&eacute; of the commune
sought to relieve it by founding a convent
which should teach the art of lace-making,
to furnish a means of earning
bread. He called the Franciscaine Sisters
who soon had 100 pupils in their lace-classes,
and among them a number of
boys. From those days to these, lace-making
in this convent has never ceased;
there are now not more than 125 pupils
in the excellent school, but in the homes
of the entire region are those who have
learned their art there. The sisters
taught first, Chantilly (Opbrakel is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>near Grammont, the Belgian home of
Chantilly), but about fifty years ago
changed from bobbin to needle lace, and
since about twelve years ago, they have
specialized on the particular needle lace,
Venetian Point, in which they are unexcelled.
Few of the enraptured tourists in
Venise realize that the laces they are buying
there were very probably made in
Flanders!</p>

<p>Important lace schools and work-rooms
have from time to time concentrated all
their skill on the production of a masterpiece
that might represent them to the
world and awaken wide interest and approval.
We have a long list of such
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chefs-d’&oelig;uvres</i> from the lace-rooms of
Belgium, of lovely scarfs and cloths
and robes offered to sovereigns or distinguished
patrons. And happily during
the war the Committee could encourage
this practise by giving orders or special
“commands” to be executed as gifts for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>benefactors. Several of these presentation
pieces will have enduring value historically
as well as artistically.</p>

<p>More than one command fell to the
share of Opbrakel, and among others that
for a scarf offered to the Queen of Holland
in appreciation of her country’s
generosity to Belgians within Dutch
borders. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span>, each proud to
be selected for the royal task, worked
many months on the countless exquisite
needle points in this delicate veil. On the
scarf ends they united the arms of Holland
and Belgium, engarlanding them with
hyacinths and tulips, the Dutch national
flowers, and about these in turn they wove
lilies of the valley, symbolizing the return
of happiness. Below the medallion rest the
Belgian provinces, enchained, and above
them they represented the children of
Holland showering flowers of abundance
upon the martyred children of their sister
kingdom.</p>

<p>It would have been pleasant to talk of
other master-works, but we had already
sat too long before the fire and we
hurried now to reach the large, airy class-room
across the court before dark. When
starting on my lace journey, I had been
warned that, once I had visited the
bobbin-lace work-room with all the picturesqueness
of the cushion with its
mounds of bobbins and clustered pins,
and of the flying fingers and the continuous
cadences of the clinking wood, I
would find needle-lace classes uninteresting.
In the beginning this was true;
there was nothing particularly dramatic
or stirring in a great room filled with
girls and young women holding little
black paper patterns in their hands and
plying a needle above them. But the
more I watched these little patterns and
the fingers directing the needle and
thread, the more marvelous the accomplishment
appeared&mdash;cotton and linen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>so fine that it seemed impossible that any
finger should control them&mdash;cobwebby,
diaphanous meshes, richly petalled tiny
flowers, and delicately veined leaves
growing beneath just a common needle
and a single thread. In the end I looked
eagerly for the needle rooms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="captioncenter">“ARMS OF YPRES” CUSHION COVER IN VENISE, WITH DETAILS IN FLANDERS</p>
</div>

<p>And this was the most rewarding one
I had yet visited. It happened that the
majority of the pupils were busy on the
details of a tablecloth recently designed
by Madame Allard, in which the linen
center is encircled by a family of little
beasts as gay as any ever gathered together
to cheer a dinner company. I
laughed outright, as a little girl, herself
laughing, held up an exquisitely worked
and most vividly real group of happy
ducks floating on a pond. The next
showed her enchanting rabbits, another
her deer&mdash;all along the line they were
chuckling over the success of their particular
pets. They had captured the sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and happy motion of a farm-yard
world with just a needle and a
single linen thread! Here, as at Erembodeghem,
only linen thread is used, because
tho it is more difficult to handle,
it produces a finer and stronger lace than
cotton. After several months (it took
six months to execute the first cloth of
this design) the details would be assembled
and joined by special workers,
following the large paper pattern the
sisters were now spreading across a table,
which had been sent down to Opbrakel
from the room of design at Brussels.
And the finished cloth, as delightful as
an early naive tapestry with its smiling
animals, would be sent to the Committee
for sale.</p>

<p>Opbrakel stands unquestionably first in
Belgium in the production of figures in
Point de Venise. During the war, its
workers have repeated several times for
the Committee their beautiful <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>“Fables de
La Fontaine” series of medallions, as well
as those which represent so charmingly
“Little Red Riding-Hood,” “Puss in
Boots,” “The Sleeping Beauty,” and
other much loved fairy-tale figures.
These medallions have been sold separately
as doilies, or have been combined
with Flanders lace or linen in handsome
cloths.</p>

<p>It was fast growing dark, and the 125
girls began folding their patterns, and
carefully wrapping their delicately pictured
little rabbits and ducks to keep
them clean till the morrow; maids appeared
with dust-pans and brooms, and
we gathered up our skirts and stept out
into the courtyard. As we crossed it in
the dark and the rain it was difficult to
refuse the further hospitality of these
sisters, who would have kept me for the
night.</p>

<small><i>The Last Lace Stronghold of Brabant</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the court in front of the big brick
convent building with its odd little
steeple, two sisters, skirts tucked up,
and pails swung over their shoulders,
Chinese fashion, were about to begin the
Saturday scrubbing. Madame Kefer-Mali
and I were on our way to Liedekerke,
the principal remaining lace center
in Brabant, and had stopt in this less important
village of Heckelgem for a look
at the convent school opened nine years
ago.</p>

<p>In the village itself we had found about
150 of the 2,000 inhabitants busy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>their needles, for this is distinctly a
needle-lace commune, producing a fairly
good quality of Venise. Which means
that there are as yet no local mills, and
tho an adjacent match factory has already
attracted a number of Heckelgem
girls, most of the women are still content
to spend their time making Venise,
which they take to the convent, to be sold
there to Brussels or other agents.</p>

<p>The convent class-rooms were warm
and cheery; fern baskets hung from the
ceilings and every window was gay with
potted plants. Practically all the village
children were gathered inside, and since
it was 11 o’clock when we arrived, were
happily engaged in drinking their daily
Comit&eacute; National cup of cocoa and in eating
the good white biscuit that goes with
it. Saturday morning is mending time
and on the girls’ desks I saw more of
those amazing patchwork socks and
stockings, the result of three or four
years’ weekly attempts to hold them together.</p>

<p class="small">Executed by 30 workers in eight months</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p>In the advanced lace class-room, thirty
girls, between thirteen and sixteen, were
working with cotton thread on Venise
insertions and on details for larger
pieces. They had come at 8 o’clock that
morning, a more humane beginning hour
than most schools allow, and would remain
as long as there was daylight&mdash;looping
and weaving with a needle and
single thread. I stopt beside Rosalie,
who was making a pretty flower detail
for a cushion cover. She had begun it
five days before and hoped to finish, and
receive the seven francs she was allowed
for it, that night.</p>

<p>On the table was a pile of chairbacks
in Venise, with figure centers and surrounding
garlands of flowers all connected
by the bars characterizing this
lace&mdash;an order for a Brussels dealer, who
had recently offered fifty-two francs each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>for them. The sisters were excited and
happy over this new price, which was considerably
more than anything Heckelgem
has hitherto been able to command, one
and a half francs a day having been the
average wage of the best workers.</p>

<p>A little farther to the south and still
in Brabant, tho it lies near the Flanders
border, is the much better known convent
of Liedekerke, which boasts an unbroken
record of sixty years of lace-making,
and which before the war received
a yearly subsidy of 800 francs from the
“Amies de la Dentelle.” As we walked
beside the pretty orchard and vegetable
garden, bright with purple cabbages,
that form the entrance court, toward the
rather impressive red-brick buildings,
again with their odd miniature steeple, I
saw the great arms of a Dutch windmill
turning lazily somewhere in the rear.
And nearer the door, off at the left in a
side court, a war-kitchen with tiled floor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>and uncertain roof, where hundreds of
the village poor still were coming for their
daily pint of soup. Of the 4,000 inhabitants
as many as 2,900 were forced on to
the soup-line during the occupation.</p>

<p>This, then, was one of the important
and successful convent schools of Belgium;
but in January, 1919, it was in a
much sadder plight than the little neighboring
school at Heckelgem. There was
no coal, not a class was in session, not a
child at work with her bobbins. At 4
o’clock in the afternoon, on Monday, October
28, when there were between 800
and 900 children, among them 100 lace-workers,
gathered in the various class-rooms,
German officers had appeared to
announce that by 7 o’clock the rooms
must be cleared of both teachers and
children. I had already had many demonstrations
of what taking possession of
school-rooms meant. It was not necessary
that the sisters should lead me from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>room to room, pointing out this or that
ruined wall, or casement torn away, or
vacant space where the benches or chairs
burned as firewood, once stood; but I followed
them about for their own sakes.
There was at least a kind of comfort in
being able to furnish proof of these outrages
to somebody.</p>

<p>One small room was undisturbed, but it
was a sadder room than any of the others.
The primary lace-class had occupied it,
and several rows of little girls were
learning to make their first flowers and
leaves when the enemy drove them out.
The baby chairs and the cushions were
just as they left them, tho thick dust
dulled the blue of the linen covers and
the tiny unfinished white roses and tendrils
held by the rusty pins. One would
have liked to bring the enemy mothers
into this room with its baby chairs, and
its dust-covered unfinished roses.</p>

<p>In the large adjoining hall Sister M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>kindly came to work at a table, on Application,
one of the laces for which
Liedekerke has been especially distinguished.
Before the English invention,
early in 1800, of machine-made tulle,
which had an incalculable influence on
the development of the lace-industry, all
meshes had to be made either with the
needle or with bobbins. The factory substitute
for these difficult processes won
instant favor, and with the general public
the more swiftly made and cheaper tulle
Application, supplanted the exquisite
Point d’Angleterre, which it imitated.
Liedekerke, for example, had begun its
lace career with Point d’Angleterre, and
in changing later to Application, was
merely responding to popular demand.
Its sixty years of lace-history reads:
Point d’Angleterre, Application, Rosaline.</p>

<p>These things Madame Kefer-Mali explained,
as Sister M. was placing her
square of blue paper on the linen of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>table cushion, and then the bobbin-made
bouquet, wrong side up on the blue square,
pinning it carefully and smoothly through
the paper to the cushion. Over this she
stretched her scarf length of tulle. I
was surprized at the time and painstaking
effort she gave to these simple operations,
until I saw later the effect of the
slightest carelessness on the finished
flounce. Almost any clever needlewoman
can join a flower to a piece of
tulle&mdash;but only an artist can produce a
beautiful scarf or veil in Application.
Once the bouquet was properly placed
and pinned, Sister M. began to sew, lifting
the tulle lightly with each stitch, and
smoothly attaching all the edges, for this
bouquet was being appliqu&eacute;d on the body
of the scarf. Had it formed the border
one edge would have remained free.</p>

<p>Liedekerke Convent, to which some
200 of the villagers bring their laces and
which once made little else than Application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
(many beautiful robes and flounces
and scarfs have gone out from the commune
and the school), now makes comparatively
little of it; for during the last
six years Paris and other markets have
asked for Rosaline. It is to be hoped that
this small quantity may be continued, and
that the lace world may still win at least
a few pieces yearly of the earlier, more
exquisite Point d’Angleterre.</p>

<p>Point d’Angleterre, so named because
of its great popularity in England,
reached its height in beauty and in favor
during the seventeenth century, when it
occupied the talent and energy of all the
lace-workers of Brussels. It differs from
Needle Point, in which both flowers and
mesh are made with the needle. It is
one of the loveliest of all laces, combining
in rare beauty, rich bouquets and
arabesques and birds of finest bobbin
work, with a frail transparent needle
mesh, the flowers themselves becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>frequently more light and delicate through
the introduction of charmingly varied
needle-worked open spaces. Certain
workers make the flowers, and others the
connecting mesh. If one can imagine the
softness of a kind of sublimated or
diaphanous velvet, added to the fragility
of an airy and cobwebby lace, one may
have some idea of the effect of good
Point d’Angleterre. And if one would
possess a collar or a flounce, one should
buy it quickly, for Point d’Angleterre is
going the way of the other difficult and
exquisite points. Such villages as
Kerxken, Liedekerke, Destelbergen (near
Ghent), and those of the Alost region
still make occasional pieces.</p>

<p>The more ordinary Point de Flandres,
or Flanders, so generally produced to-day,
has the same composition as Point
d’Angleterre, since in it bobbin-work
flowers are joined by a needle-mesh. And
even tho coarser and less complicated
than Point d’Angleterre, Point de
Flandres is also difficult to make, and
should be much better paid. There are
innumerable differences in quality, and
many ways in which this lace may be employed.
The Committee has used it
chiefly in elegant table centers and cloths,
in lamp-shades and in various articles to
embellish a drawing-or dining-room.
And this summer of 1919 it is being used
with much success by important French
houses as trimming for dainty <i>ninon</i> underclothing.
Nineteenth century Point de
Flandres, then, is little more than a commercial
name for a very coarse kind of
Point d’Angleterre.</p>

<p>This Point de Flandres must not be
confused with Old Flanders or Antik, the
ancient bobbin-lace experiencing a happy
revival at present. Old Flanders is, like
Cluny, made entirely with bobbins and
with uncut threads; in other words, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>single lengths, and not in separate or cut
details.</p>

<p>Liedekerke, then, first made Point
d’Angleterre for which, after a certain
time, it substituted Application, changing
again about two years before the war to
Rosaline, suddenly become a popular lace.</p>

<p>Rosaline is not very different in appearance
from the finer varieties of
Bruges; in fact, it employs much the
same technique, and is made as is Bruges
with bobbins, in small pieces, which are
later joined by special workers. A
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;re</span> who can make fine Bruges can
usually make Rosaline. Each small
piece is composed of elaborately interlacing
flowers and leaves and arabesques,
without a connecting mesh, but joined
by <i>brides</i> or bars, with a picot edge.
Sometimes the tiny incrustations called
pearls, common to Burano lace, are
added, to further ornament the richly
covered ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>I watched a Rosaline cushion, on which
the pattern of an arabesque detail was
pinned, and Sister A., as she began to
shift in pairs the fourteen bobbins needed
to execute it; one pair, the <i>voyageurs</i>,
were continually traveling from right to
left and back again as she wove the flat
parts of the leaves and blossoms. The
Rosaline technique is particularly difficult,
since the pins must be continually and
rapidly changed as the worker, with a
crochet-hook, lifts the thread to pass her
bobbin through in the characteristic loop
stitch. This delicate operation, constantly
repeated, strains both eyes and
nerves. The pins are placed along the
outside edge of the flowers, instead of inside,
as in Bruges, which produces the
picot or looped-edge effect of Rosaline.
In Bruges the flower edges are even.</p>

<p>I turned from the arabesques just beginning
to grow on the cushion, to a
lovely little finished detail, about four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>inches square, one of several in a box
which was to hold them till they could
be joined to make a scarf. It had taken
seven days of thirteen hours each to
make this four by four piece, which meant
that the maximum a skilled worker could
earn in executing it was about two francs
a day.</p>

<p>The Liedekerke convent school does not
accept children under twelve for more
than two complete afternoons a week and
for more than one hour each of the other
days, these hours being lengthened gradually
until the girl of sixteen gives her
entire time to her lace. The sisters hope
that once they find coal and thread and
can put their class-room in order, they
may again have 100 pupils, and that the
village may continue to count at least
200 good <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span>.</p>

<small><i>A Château of Refuge</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> are certain châteaux in Belgium
that will be remembered
throughout this century as harbors of
refuge; they dared not flare beacons
from their roofs, but during four dark
years, people of the nearby communes
knew that day and night lights burned
there for them. The château of the
Comte du Parc was such a one, a property
lying on the edge of the village of
Herzele, south of Alost, which, tho the
house itself is unpretentious, embraces a
lovely park and wood, and from which,
incidentally, the Germans cut 1,000 trees.
It is no longer only the estate of the du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Parcs, it is the loved shelter of every
villager accustomed to hurry toward it
in sad or perilous hours. The morale of
the entire region was sustained by the
knowledge that the people of the château
had not left, as they easily might have,
for their safer Brussels home, in the zone
of civil administration, where if not free,
they would at least have been less imprisoned,
but had chosen to remain in
the military zone, utterly cut off from
their relatives and the rest of Belgium.</p>

<p>They might have considered several
reasons sufficiently important to
call them away (the Bourgmestre of
Herzele had found at least one, his ill-health);
among other things their
château was as yet practically uninhabitable.
It had been begun only a short
time before the war broke out, and with
the sounding of the first alarm the workmen
had rushed out to report to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>officers, leaving electric cords dangling,
unmounted fixtures standing against the
walls, and neither hot water nor heating
systems installed. Madame told me later
of her desperate and amusing efforts to
fasten locks on the most important doors.
As she and her husband were debating
how they might arrange one large room
in the left wing as their single general
living-room they could already see the
villagers coming anxiously along the
tree-lined avenue and across the park to
inquire if they were still there. “After
the first troubled questions,” Monsieur
said, “even if we had not already decided
we must stay, it would have been quite
impossible to go away.”</p>

<p>The soldiers of the village were leaving
with scarcely time for good-bys; Madame
understood the fears of the women who
came to the château for comfort; her
only son, too, a brave, handsome boy, was
off to join the colors&mdash;her brave, handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
boy, who now lies buried not far from the
Yser.</p>

<p>In October the victorious Germans
pushed southward, and from the <abbr title="fourteenth">14th</abbr> to
the <abbr title="eighteenth">18th</abbr>, shrapnel fell like rain on the
park, but the château escaped unharmed.
Then three officers of the occupying army
rode up on horseback, revolvers in hand,
demanding that the Comte present himself
immediately. Madame followed her
husband, not knowing what to expect.
To their first threat, Monsieur replied
calmly, “I do not like those objects,” and
after a moment’s hesitation the officers
lowered their weapons. Then they demanded
guaranties that they would be
absolutely safe from attack by any person,
either of the château or the village.
“I can, of course, speak for my château,”
Monsieur answered, “but I can not be responsible
for the villagers if they are
pushed too far.” These villagers themselves
told me later that they were convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
it was only the presence of the
Comte (the bullies were frequently servile
before titles and powerless before fearlessness)
that saved Herzele from destruction.
“We always expected the
worst,” they said; “in the early days,
when the Boches lighted a great fire in
the wood, we rushed to the château, believing
it was burning.”</p>

<p>From the beginning, Madame and her
two daughters looked for some constructive
aid they might give their
women, something more than the general
relief furnished by the Comit&eacute; National.</p>

<p>Of the 2,500 inhabitants of the village,
1,700 were soon on the lists of the helpless
or destitute; among these were many
tuberculosis victims. The château living-room
became first a clothing bureau,
where daily all sorts of garments, sent
from America, were distributed. Madame
engaged some of the women of the village
to patch and re-fashion these, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>certain sums of money that succeeded in
reaching her from time to time from an
American lady who had “adopted”
Herzele, she was able to purchase new
materials and offer further saving employment.
I do not know the American
lady, but if she could have seen Madame’s
eyes as she told me of what it meant, imprisoned
as they were, to receive these
gifts from some one outside who remembered
them, I do not doubt she would
have felt sufficiently rewarded.</p>

<p>In 1916, when I was in Belgium as a
member of the Commission for Relief in
Belgium, the Germans prevented my
going near Herzele, or any point in the
zone of direct military preparation, so I
could follow the work of Monsieur and
Madame only through the Brussels Lace
Committee, which had itself great difficulty
in keeping connected with them.
They made their judgments from the
ever increasing quantities and improved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>quality of the laces that somehow came
through.</p>

<p>The room in the château was the lace
office not only for Herzele, but for eleven
additional villages, where between 2,500
and 3,000 girls and women, encouraged
by the Committee support&mdash;its designs
and thread and money&mdash;were busy with
their needles and bobbins; for while this
is chiefly a needle-work district, large
quantities of bobbin laces are also made.
To be sure, none of these laces is superior,
but they are good, and marketable. They
include Cluny, Duchesse de Bruxelles, a
kind of coarse Flanders (where the
flowers are made with bobbins and the
mesh with the needle), Venise, and Rosaline;
and of these the Flanders and Venise
are most important. At times it was not
difficult for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span> to take or
send their finished lace to the château, at
others they were threatened with fines
and imprisonment if they were discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>trying to get it there. To refer to but
one instance, the facteur of the village
three miles distant was fined seventy-five
francs when caught on the way with his
pieces. The Germans were doing their
utmost always, to attach lace-makers to
their <i>Spitzen Centrale</i>, and despite the
international agreement which engaged
their protection of the work of the
Brussels Lace Committee, they interfered
with and obstructed its work again and
again. At one point they insisted that
all deliveries to the Committee should be
made through them, and that they be
paid 1 per cent. on the value, in gold, for
transmission, where transmission, unfortunately,
only too often spelled for
them retention.</p>

<p>In the village Madame and her daughters
went from house to house, instructing
and comforting. The days of the deportations
were more terrible than any
others. In remembering that first hideous
deportation night in Herzele, one remembers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
too, that early in the war Cardinal
Mercier said that while there was once a
time, when to make people believe, we
felt we must heighten, or embellish the
cold facts, that now in order that they
should believe, we must withhold part of
the truth. That first night, men and
boys were torn from their beds and
herded into the school, from there to be
carried off in cattle-cars to Germany.
There was neither light nor heat, and in
the cold and the darkness, the tortured
little village broke into a great cry of
lamentation, while the château was filled
with wives and mothers seeking comfort.</p>

<p>Later, when the activist troubles became
acute, the two daughters held meetings
even in the cabarets to urge loyalty
to a united Belgium. They believe that
not one person in their entire village can
be said to have worked for the enemy,
except when deported bodily, or otherwise
coerced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>Somehow the years passed, and then
one day, the <abbr title="sixteenth">16th</abbr> of September, 1917,
bits of white paper fell like snow from
the clouds. The family rushed out to
gather them and found Lord Northcliffe’s
celebrated posters, “The First Million,”
representing a vast multitude on the
march, the statue of liberty in the background,
the fields of France in the foreground,
and a continuous bridge of ships
connecting them. This snowfall was followed
by others, and each brought hope.</p>

<p>Finally, in October, 1918, the Germans,
knowing the Allied Army of Liberation
was almost upon them, again pulled their
guns up into the château grounds, but in
the final fighting, as in the earliest, the
house somehow escaped.</p>

<p>When I reached Herzele, in January,
1919, the wide park was beautiful and
still, green things were sprouting beneath
the trees, there were a few birds; to a
stranger there was little evidence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>terrible years. But inside, in the cold, unfinished
hall, the electric cords still dangled;
everything was as the Belgian workmen
had left it four and a half years before.
And in the single living-room at the
left, rudely furnished, but including
through large windows the beauty of the
park, there were still the war-time desk
and long table with the piles of trousers
and shirts at one end, and the rolls of white
lace at the other. I shook out a scarf of
Duchesse de Bruxelles of flower and leaf
pattern, with insets in needle work, and
several wide flounces of Flanders lace, of
the same pattern I had seen used in the
charming lamp-shades on sale in the
Committee room at Brussels. There were
also rolls of Bruges, and Rosaline, Application,
and Point d’Angleterre.</p>

<p>As I examined them, Monsieur got out
his records and discust the future of his
lace-workers. “I am convinced they will
be happy to continue in this district, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
only they can be sure of a living wage.
And apart from other determining
factors, to make that, they must learn to
execute laces of better quality. We need,
above all, a school which will offer along
with its courses in practical lace-making,
training in design. During the war we
had many beautiful designs from the
Committee, but each time we were cut
off from them we realized our helplessness.
In one of the villages the patterns
are drawn by a furniture-maker. One
reason for the wretched condition of the
workers before the war was their entire
dependence on the particular lace dealer
who furnished them their patterns and
their thread, and who, of course, protected
his models by copyright. The old,
unprotected designs, which may be copied
by any one, are little in demand, and
during the process of generations of recopying,
many of them have so greatly
deteriorated as to become scarcely recognizable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
If our women were trained they
could restore these, and, what is more
important, some of them, at least, could
invent new ones.”</p>

<p>I asked what it would cost to found a
school and support it during its first year.
“Perhaps 20,000 or 25,000 francs; we
might hope that the State would undertake
such a work, but with its present
overwhelming burden, it is a question if
the Government can occupy itself with
lace needs. If it could be started by
private initiative, and prove successful, I
believe there is no doubt that the Government
would be willing later to subsidize
it.”</p>

<p>Madame brought a picture post-card
from the mantel, of three brothers who
had been deported, two of whom had not
returned. Other men were drifting back
from Metz, where most of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;port&eacute;s</i>
from Herzele had been for over two and
a half years, but these two would not
return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> for they had been frozen to death.
I understood at once, for I remembered
the sixty-five men with black arms and
legs who had been “returned” to the
Brussels Hospital in 1917. “No”;
Madame looked at the portrait of her
boy, with the Belgian colors above it and
a vase of flowers in front, and then again
at the little post-card; “No,” she said
simply, “I have no desire yet to go to
Brussels. I prefer to remain here with
my people, where we may still, from time
to time, weep together.”</p>

<small><i>A Lace Queen of Long Ago</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Of</span> the cities I visited during three
months’ continuous travel in Belgium
following the armistice, Ghent
appeared to me to be attacking her
problems with greatest speed and vigor.
Brave old Burgher city of canals and
mellow buildings and bell-towers, this
Flemish capital is at the same time
an active, modern, commercial center;
which explains why Bruges has been able
to win from her the title she once proudly
held of “Queen of Lace Cities.”</p>

<p>The lace history of Ghent begins with
the lace history of Belgium, in the sixteenth
century; but her great period dates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>from the seventeenth century and the introduction
of the epoch-making mesh of
Valenciennes. The activity of her women
and girls, following the appearance of
this new lace, surpassed anything she had
hitherto known; it was not long before
the music of 1,000,000 bobbins rose to
meet the riotous pealing of her bells. In
the sixteenth century Malines had undisputed
first place in lace; Ghent now out-stript
her. One wonders if part of the
fascination of this city for the men the
United States sent there in 1814, to make
peace with England, and who, after six
months’ lingering, had to be urged to
return home, lay in its clicking bobbins
and the joyous garlands that blossomed
under them.</p>

<p>There is a portrait in the Hôtel de
Ville, where one may see the Empress
Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, wearing the marvelous
Valenciennes and the Needle Point robe
presented to her by the Canton de Gand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>in 1743. And scarcely more than a century
later, in 1853, the city made its last
gift of similar magnificence&mdash;another
robe, valued at 20,000 francs, on which
80,000 bobbins were employed unceasingly
during six months, and this time
offered to the Duchess of Brabant,
Marie-Henriette. There were no succeeding
world-stirring gifts of lace because
Ghent had begun to think of other things,
of industrial and commercial development,
and as she advanced in these, the
art of lace-making declined, until to-day
it has ceased to exist.</p>

<p>However, in the surrounding communes
(the region counts fifty) there are
still perhaps 2,000 <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dentelli&egrave;res</span> making
most of the bobbin and needle varieties,
the best among them being Valenciennes,
Flanders, Duchesse, Needle Point, Bruges
and Rosaline. The Comtesse de Bousies,
chairman of the Ghent Lace Committee
during the war, did her best to encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the work in these outlying districts,
and was able to help, in addition,
many needy women in the city itself.</p>

<p>In 1917, for instance, Celine appeared
at the office to ask for thread. She was
twenty years old, and before the war had
been one of the 10,000 women employed
in the linen spinning mills; her mother
was ill with tuberculosis, her father without
work, and also ill; there were five
younger children. “I know I have not
proper fingers,” she said, as she held out
her rough hands, “but if you will only
promise I may bring my lace, I believe I
can learn.” The Committee believed this,
too, and because she worked with intelligence
and with almost feverish eagerness,
she was soon assured the minimum wage
of three francs a week, and later the
larger sums made possible with the Committee’s
success. Shortly before the
armistice, the mother died, and only last
week Celine came again to the desk to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>ask anxiously if the Committee could not
somehow arrange, that even after they
had disbanded, she might continue to
make lace. Her father had found a
little work; she wanted to remain at home
where she might at least direct the
younger children, and she could, if only
she were sure of her war-time wage.
Could not the Committee promise the sale
of her laces? Often repeated question
during these courage-testing days, when
emergency organizations are breaking
up, and poor women do not yet see what
is to replace them.</p>

<p>Among the more important communes
on the Ghent committee list, I found
Oosterzele, Baelegem, and Landsanter,
all three producing a good quality of
Duchesse, Flanders, Needle Point and
Venise, and counting together about 160
lace-makers; Gysenzeele and Destelbergen,
which make fine Flanders, and
Duchesse, Knesselars, with 250 Cluny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>workers; Asper with 60 in Venise; the
convents of Scheldewinkle and Eecke, the
first occupied with Venise, the second
with Needle Point and Duchesse, which
it sells to an American house, and finally,
the larger Deynze district, including
Vynck, Lootenhulle, Machelin, the Valenciennes
convent school at Ruysselede, and
Bachte, with perhaps 400 lace-makers in
all.</p>

<p>I got my orientation for this last southern
district from the Comtesse d’Alcantara,
who has been indefatigable in her
double r&ocirc;le of chairman of Deynze and
vice-chairman of the regional committee.
Constantly throughout the war, she
might have been seen starting from the
handsome ch&acirc;teau at Bachte&mdash;one of the
most imposing in Belgium&mdash;on bicycle
or on foot on her way to one of the lace
villages, with thread and money for the
workers, or at night returning with the
rolls of lace which she had then to get to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>Ghent and from there to Brussels. The
Germans never succeeded in obstructing
her work, nor that of her father and
mother, for their villagers and for the
orphans of the entire region. Women
came between shells to bring laces. It
was a moral help just to be able to talk
about their work.</p>

<p>As I crossed the moat and passed under
the archway, I saw the spot where
the last Allied shell exploded, killing nineteen
Germans, while the family and the
200 villagers in the cellars, where they
had been for two weeks, escaped unharmed.
In fact, in all the Deynze
country I was in the midst of the destruction
accompanying the final push of the
liberating army, and was vividly reminded
of what would have happened to
the rest of Belgium had the armistice
been further delayed.</p>

<p>But already in the partially wrecked
villages many of the women had gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>back to their cushions&mdash;their reason-saving
cushions, for they furnished practically
the only employment to be had,
and however small the earnings, they at
least insured a few francs a week, and
best of all they proved that something of
the past persisted.</p>

<p>In Vynck, a poor little town of 1,700
people, I found 40 Valenciennes-makers,
and heard that 100 young girls were
being taught at home by their mothers.
I talked with two maiden sisters&mdash;one 68,
the other 72&mdash;whom I spied hidden behind
a window-screen of potted plants,
working, with 450 bobbins each, on a
kind of Valenciennes one finds only on
the cushions of the past generation. They
could not repeat often enough their gratitude
to the Committee, which had been
paying them 44 francs ($8.80) a meter
for their lace, so much more than they
had received before the war from the
Courtrai facteur to whom they had sold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>They counted on making about five
meters during the winter ($44 worth),
and they work from dawn sometimes till
nine at night.</p>

<p>In a neighboring house was a grandmother
of eighty-one and her granddaughter,
and on the grandmother’s
cushion such a covering and re-covering
of bobbins and lace, to keep them spotless.
Over all she had spread a large
towel, beneath it a worn napkin, then a
piece of pink gingham, and below that
two remnants of white and blue cloth,
and it seemed appropriate that the snowy
treasure, Valenciennes, too, should be revealed
to me only after such a ceremony
of unveiling as this bent old woman of
Vynck performed.</p>

<p>I passed quickly through Lootenhulle
with its 125 workers, who make, among
other varieties, good Duchesse and Rosaline;
and Hansbeek, which produces a
superior Valenciennes; and Ruysselede,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>with its excellent school for Valenciennes;
to cross from the south to Destelbergen,
which lies almost directly east of Ghent.
All the plain was white under the first
deep snow of winter, but to enjoy its
loveliness one had to be able to forget the
torn roofs and fireless hearths.</p>

<p>At Destelbergen I went at once to the
atelier of <abbr title="Madam">Mme.</abbr> Coppens, to whom
women of both France and Belgium send
their old Applications and spider-web
meshes, for restoration. Before the war
she employed seventy expert lace-makers
in her school, now she can depend on no
more than twenty&mdash;tho there are some
100 less skilful ones in the village. On
this particular January day the school
was empty. As <abbr title="Madam">Mme.</abbr> Coppens received
me, she said, “I regret, Madame, but I
am without coal, and without thread; I
have been forced to close my work-room;
however,” she hesitated an instant, “if
Madame does not object to coming into
the kitchen, she may yet see St&eacute;phanie,
the first lace-maker of the village, at
work.”</p>

</div>

<p>Remembering the glistening shelves
and floors of other Flemish kitchens, I
did not mind; happily not, for in the end
St&eacute;phanie was more to me than many
villages. She was bending over an immaculate
cushion, seventy-eight and unmarried,
and all her person as scrupulously
neat as her cushion, from her odd
little peaked black crochet cap to the felt
shoes she had made herself. She was
weaving the flat surfaces of a dainty
French bouquet, and as I stept toward
her chair, looked up, delighted that some
one was interested in what she was making.
When I picked up a Bruges collar
on the nearby table she tried in ejaculatory
Flemish to make me understand,
that even tho she had made parts of it,
she disowned the whole as unworthy the
name of lace, and she brought my eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>back to the delicate texture of the leaves
and petals on her cushion.</p>

<p>I wished to know what St&eacute;phanie was
getting for a day’s work on her fine
bouquets. She has been making lace for
seventy years, is intelligent and quick,
and her maximum wage is two cents an
hour, a franc for a day of ten hours. I
asked about the future&mdash;she has thought
of that, not without anxiety, and is providing
at seventy-eight for what she calls
“old age” by trying hard to put by two
cents a week. Madame C. has been kind
to her, and gives her as much freedom
and comfort as she can offer; for instance,
when St&eacute;phanie was ill for three
days last week, she did not deduct her
wages. She would gladly double her pay,
or triple it, for she realizes there are few
like St&eacute;phanie left, but the Paris firm to
whom she sells pays so little for her lace
that she has never been able to offer more
than a franc a day. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>“If I could give two
francs, I could quickly gather a company
of 1,000 contented lace-makers, I am certain,”
she said. “But when my old
workers fall ill or die, I find no young
girls willing to come to me; they prefer
the twenty francs a week they can make
picking wool. When St&eacute;phanie goes, I
shall have no single artist to replace her.”
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un vrai c&oelig;ur de dentelle</i>” (she
is a true heart of lace), she said affectionately,
as she patted her on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>And then she went to fetch a cardboard
box and I took a chair by the table, to
watch her unfold what it might contain.
She spread three beautiful widths of Application
on blue paper so that I might
better see the tiny bouquets and scattered
buds and leaves that blossomed from the
fine quality of machine-made tulle; all
these had come from St&eacute;phanie’s bobbins,
and she was having difficulty to continue
at her cushion because of her eagerness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>to explain them. They were French designs,
as their charming lines had made
me suspect. In the box with the Application
were two rolls of Point d’Angleterre,
the lace one finds rarely at present.
We held the first one, a length of four
meters, six inches wide, against the light,
and then St&eacute;phanie could sit still no
longer; she knew something about this
piece, for she had made its first flower in
1911, and not finished its last until the
war was half over. She pointed out the
spaces where a special needle-worker
had introduced almost microscopic open
stitches into her leaves and blooms to
give them even greater airiness, and
showed how almost impossible it would
have been to execute these needle-stitches
with bobbins; and how difficult is the
stitch made with a special crochet-hook
required for the raised veins and outlines
(brodes) of the petals and leaves, since
the hook must catch and attach the thread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>each time beneath the surface. Finally,
a needle-worker, again, as is always the
case in Point d’Angleterre, had spun the
clear web between the flowers, uniting
them all into the finished flounce.
St&eacute;phanie pointed to a single detail. “It
took me five days to make that tiny
bouquet, and the needle-worker one and
a half days more to add the open
stitches.”</p>

<p>Since the snow-covered roads made
traveling extremely hazardous, I decided
that I could not stop longer, no matter
how absorbing the Applications and
Points d’Angleterre, or how endearing
the personality and contagious the enthusiasm
of St&eacute;phanie. I said “Good-by,”
explaining that I had yet that day
to visit the needle-lace school at Zele,
twenty kilometers away.</p>

<small><i>St&eacute;phanie Visits the Trade Union Lace School</i></small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">But</span> I was not to have to part with
St&eacute;phanie. When her Flemish
ears gathered from my French that
I was starting for Zele and the school
founded three years ago, which had
been the talk of the region ever
since, her eyes fairly spoke her eager
desire. Seventy-eight and earning twenty
cents a day, and yet consumed by a love
for her art (for with her, lace-making is
a true art), and a passion to learn more
about it! I asked <abbr title="Madam">Mme.</abbr> Coppens if
St&eacute;phanie might not come along in the
car. In answer she began bustling
about, tears in her eyes, to help get her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
ready, and St&eacute;phanie in her odd little
woolen cap could scarcely tie her long
black-hooded cape because she was constantly
throwing up her hands, and exclaiming,
and pressing them together, as
she tried to make me understand that in
all her seventy-eight years she had only
twice ridden in a wagon and never had
she dreamed of being in an automobile
before she died. What would the neighbors
say? We bundled her into the
corner of the car and were off, but she
could not sit still, leaning forward to exclaim
over the beauty of the snow, or a
windmill, or the children skating in their
sabots, or huddling down to cover her
face with her hands in swift shyness if
some one had seemed to see her; no spirit
was ever so bubbling and gay and eager
and timid all at once as St&eacute;phanie’s as
we rode through the snow toward Zele.</p>

<p>Nor so patient as hers after we arrived;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for instead of going to the school,
I had to leave her in the car while I went
to the house of the director, Dr. Armand
Rubbens, unfortunately ill with rheumatism,
who is not only the founder of
the school but the inspiration of all the
unusual accomplishments of the lace-workers
of this town, where his father is
Burgomaster. After her long wait,
St&eacute;phanie’s only comment as she looked
a little fearfully at the gathering dusk,
was: “It is not yet too late to see the
school.”</p>

<p>Inside, Dr. Rubbens, who since taking
his university degree has not been strong
enough to follow his profession, and has
devoted himself to the 800 lace-workers of
his district, explained the organization of
the Zele “Trade Union Lace School,”
founded three years ago and the only one
of its kind in Belgium. I felt, as he talked,
that he was reproducing in miniature a
Henry Ford plant, and when I told him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>this, he smiled. “I begin to think I should
see one of Mr. Ford’s factories, for in
reading an account of his system in the
Paris <i>Matin</i> last week, I was astonished
at the number of his ideas I had incorporated.”</p>

<p>The fifty advanced workers in the
atelier (there are 140 apprentices) share
the profit of the lace sales in proportion
to their wages, and own part of the stock
of the union. The best workers of this
group make twenty-five centimes an hour,
or two and a half francs (fifty cents) a
day of eight hours, the highest pay I
know of, so far, gained by a lace-maker.
The girls may go four hours each week
to a school of domestic science, without
losing pay; there are illness and pension
funds, and other provisions for the health
and protection of the members of the
school. Dr. Rubbens has seemed to accept
every opportunity as a privilege.</p>

<p>I looked over the files and photographs
and records, for even tho Zele is a remote
town of but 6,000 inhabitants, this wide-awake
director has made it provide for
him a better set of records and announcement
and advertising cards (some of
them in English) than I have seen anywhere
else in Belgium. While I was inspecting
the books, he opened a chest and
spread on the table a finished model from
his school&mdash;a Needle Point scarf or veil,
sown with marguerites and varied by a
bewildering succession of open-work
stitches, each seemingly more exquisite
than the preceding and some of them
invented for this particular veil. The
needle-workers who had made it had
given about 9,000 hours to its flowers
and gauze, and it would bring 3,000
francs to the Trade Union treasury.</p>

OF THE NEEDLE-POINT SCARF PRESENTED TO

</div>

<p>I felt that I must fetch St&eacute;phanie to
see this, but Dr. Rubbens advised hurrying
now to the school, where there was
something still more beautiful to be
seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&mdash;the scarf just completed that will
be presented to Queen Elizabeth, and so far
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’&oelig;uvre</i> of the Zele
lace-makers. I told St&eacute;phanie about it
on our way through the village.</p>

<p>Once arrived, we went directly to the
most advanced class, where St&eacute;phanie
might find most to interest her. The
young women were at work on Needle
Point collars and medallions, a series of
tableaux from the legend of the Fox and
the Grapes, and she was all eyes and
ears as she went eagerly from chair to
chair, trying to see what these girls had
been taught that she had missed learning,
and to add to her lore, if she could. I
believe it is only in such a modern school
as this that an outsider would have been
allowed to examine, as St&eacute;phanie did, the
stitches and patterns, for the tradition
of the locked door and the carefully
guarded secret still prevails in the lace
word.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<p>I was impatient to see the school’s masterpiece,
the royal scarf, and it was now
brought from the safe and held before
us by three young women, as the directress
led us from point to point in the
airy mesh spun between its rose garlands
and medallions. On either side of the
center medallion, the arms of Belgium,
were two others, in which human figures
symbolized cities the war has made immortal.
For Nieuport a fisher-maiden
stood on the shore with her basket, and
about her the net took up a cockleshell
motif; Poperinghe had the graceful
hop-vine as its device; for Furnes there
was a dairy-maid with her churn in the
midst of blossoming butter flowers; while
Ypres was represented by a beautiful
Flamande sitting before a lace cushion
heaped with bobbins&mdash;countless stitches,
occupying 12,000 hours, and the entire
weight 125 grammes! And yet, at the
end, St&eacute;phanie tilted her dear old head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>and said: “Nevertheless, Madame, for the
Queen, I should have made the mesh yet
finer.”</p>

<p>This Trade Union is in a sense a professional
school, since it teaches design,
but there is the weak spot in an otherwise
remarkable achievement. The designs
executed by Dr. Rubbens and the school
are often the kind that have led foreign
lace-buyers to order through Paris, which
could furnish the drawings, rather than
direct from Belgium. They lack the
lightness and grace that lace designs
should unfailingly possess, just the qualities
which the Friends of Lace have done
so much to encourage and cultivate. If
Dr. Rubbens can see his way to follow
their suggestions, or to employing a
French teacher, there seems no limit to
what he may accomplish.</p>

<p>He is now attempting to establish a
true needle-lace Normal School, which will
offer courses in commerce, English, history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and all the branches necessary to a
complete lace education. This will supplement
the instruction of the Bruges
bobbin-lace Normal, already well under
way. He holds that the teaching of the
fine needle points is more tedious and
difficult than the teaching of the bobbin
points, and that it takes more years to
become expert in needle laces than in
others.</p>

<p>On the way home, St&eacute;phanie asked
what she might do for me. “You may
pray for me, if you wish, St&eacute;phanie.”
She was silent a moment. “But, Madame,
should I not make a pilgrimage to
Lourdes for you? On one of my trips
in the wagon, I saw the sea, and for
three years after that the sea was every
day just before my eyes. And to-day
will remain until I die just in front of my
eyes. Madame, should I not go to
Lourdes for you?”</p>

<p class="center"><i>With Drawings by the Directrice of the Brussels
School of Design, <abbr title="Madam">Mme.</abbr> Lucie Paulis</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> the point of view of technique, all
laces are divided into two groups; laces
made with the needle, and laces made
with bobbins.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><i><abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Laces Made with the Needle</i></p>

<p>All needle lace is executed in the same manner.
First, the design of the whole is divided into details
sufficiently small to allow of their being
easily held and turned by the worker. The design
of each of these details is reproduced on a
special kind of black paper by means of tiny
pricked holes that follow all its lines.</p>

<p>The lace worker sews this pattern (or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqure</i>)
to a piece of double white cloth, which gives it
solidity. She is then ready to begin the <i>trac&eacute;</i>
or outlining process. A strand of two or three
threads is appliqu&eacute;d along all the contours of
the pattern by means of a very fine needle and
very fine thread, which catches the cloth below
the black paper, passing and repassing through
each of the holes of the pattern, thus holding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>outlining strand in a sort of embrace. When all
the contours of the drawing have been traced,
the second part of the work begins, the execution
of the points that are to fill in the spaces.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i_280.jpg" id="i_280.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_280.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="161" />
<p class="captioncenter"><i>c.</i> The outlining or tracing cord</p>
</div>

<p>All the points or stitches of needle lace are
loops, simple or twisted, formed by a needle
carrying a single thread. (The worker holds the
needle with the base instead of the point, forward.)
The first row of loops is attached to the
threads of the outlining strand. Arriving at the
extremity of the space she is working, the lace-maker
begins a second row of loops running in
the opposite direction, attaching each loop to the
corresponding loop of the first row. At the end
of this row she fastens it to the outlining strand
by one or two stitches and starts on the third
row, repeating this operation until her space is
completely covered.</p>

<p>The <i>points</i> or stitches most frequently employed
are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The plat (sketch d), or stitch which forms
the flat woven parts, which can be more or
less tightly drawn, and serves for all the
opaque parts of the lace. It is made by
simple loops, each row being consolidated
by means of a stretched thread as illustrated
in the sketch.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>2. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jours</i> or open-work stitches. Among
the fantasy stitches employed in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jours</span>
are:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>point one</i>, or stitch one, (sketch e.)</p>

<p>There exists also a stitch <i>two</i>, and stitch
<i>three</i>, which differ in the number of loops
forming the group.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>mirror</i> stitch (sketch f.) and a kind of
<i>ball</i> stitch (sketch g.), and lastly the famous
extremely transparent <i>point de gaze</i>, or
gauze stitch (sketch h.), which constitutes
the mesh of the popular Brussels lace.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i_284.jpg" id="i_284.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_284.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="320" />
<p class="captioncenter"><i>g.</i> Ball stitch</p>
</div>

<p>All the surfaces having been covered, the lace
is further embellished by the confection of
<i>brodes</i>, or firm outlining cords around the filled-in
spaces, which produce a more or less striking
effect of relief in needle laces. This <i>brode</i>
(sketch i), is made of a strand of fine or heavier
threads, appliqu&eacute;d as was the original strand
outlining the pattern spaces, and then beautifully
covered by the buttonhole stitch. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>brode is well made, the buttonhole stitches follow
closely, touching side by side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i_285.jpg" id="i_285.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_285.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="330" />
<p class="captioncenter"><i>h.</i> Gauze mesh stitch</p>
</div>

<p>Many differing little details which help to give
to needle lace its richness and brilliancy (balls,
rings, etc.), are also varieties of brodes, and are
made for the most part in the buttonhole stitch.
The bars forming the base of Venise lace are
made in this way.</p>

<p>The execution of the brodes is the final work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>in needle lace. After they are finished, the lace
detail is detached from the underlying pattern by
cutting the thread between the black paper and
supporting cloth, the fine thread which in the
beginning attached the outlining strand. There
remains only to join the separate details of the
pattern by a very fine stitch called the <i>point
invisible</i>.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><i><abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Bobbin Lace</i></p>

<p>Bobbin laces fall under two groups: (1) Those
made with cut threads, and (2) those made with
continuous threads.</p>

<p>1. Laces made with cut threads, or of repeated
details, are executed on a round cushion, which
can be easily turned and they require but a limited
number of bobbins (generally not more than
two dozen). They may be said to be composed
essentially of a braid which grows wider or narrower
as it follows all the variations of the pattern,
and is interrupted as often as is necessary.</p>

<p>The parts in process of operation are attached
to those already finished by veritable running
knots made with the aid of a little crochet needle,
a tool absolutely indispensable to the making of
this kind of lace. The design of the whole is
divided into portions so small that they cover only
the middle of the cushion. It is necessary to have
all around the detail, space for the bobbins, each
of which carries a thread about four inches long.</p>

<p class="captioncenter"><i>k.</i> A pattern for bobbin lace, with l,
m, n, the braids in which it must
be executed</p>
</div>

<p>Each fragment is traced on a dark blue paper
or <i>patron</i> on which the place for the pins is not
indicated (sketch k.). The lace-maker pins this
blue paper to the middle of her cushion, covering
the whole with a piece of dark blue linen which
has a hole in the middle large enough to leave free
the part of the pattern actually being worked. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a><br /><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a><br /><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>lace already finished is thus protected. She then
places a pin on the spot where she decides to
begin, attaching the necessary number of bobbins
and starts to weave as a weaver does, first
from right to left, then from left to right, carrying
the two bobbins holding the threads forming
the woof (<i>trame</i>) successively above and below
the threads forming the warp (<i>chaine</i>). Each
time all of the threads of the warp have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a><br /><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>crossed by the threads of the woof, she places
a pin, and now the two woof threads caught by
this pin lead back to the opposite side. She turns
her cushion according to the direction of the
braid she is executing, so that the threads forming
the warp always fall vertically.</p>

<p>The fundamental stitch in these laces and that

the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point de toile</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toile</i> (sketch 1.). Certain
open stitches are also employed, the most common

pleasing result).</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Rosaline (an imitation with bobbins of

<p>2. Lace made with uncut or continuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>threads. Laces of this group are executed on a
stationary cushion. The design, before it can
be used by the worker, must pass through the
hands of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</i>, or interpreter, who prepares
what is called the patron or pattern (sketch o),
that is to say, determines in advance the places
where the pins destined to hold the threads, must
be placed (sketch of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqure</span>, p.). This work of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqueuse</span> demands great skill and infinite
patience. Upon her interpretation will depend
the aspect of the lace, for the worker follows her
indications rigidly. This pattern is pricked on a
supple and resistant cardboard (in olden times it
was made on parchment) and is pinned to the
cushion with the selvage of the lace at the left.
The worker then attaches to a row of pins placed
all across the top of the pattern, the threads
which she will need, often many hundreds.</p>

<p>Now she commences her work, braiding, twisting,
intercrossing the threads in diverse ways,
and placing a pin each time the threads must be
held in a position which they can not retain without
the aid of a fixt support. When she arrives
at the bottom of her pattern, with great care she
takes out all the pins, and lifts her work to the
top of the pattern, replacing the pins so that the
lace will be kept absolutely regular. She then
recommences her work of braiding or weaving,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a><br /><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>repeating the same operation till the length of
lace she must make is finished. The patterns are
usually about a foot long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>
<p>The bobbin laces made with continuous thread
comprise:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Cluny and<br /></p>
<p><i>b.</i> Laces with a mesh base:</p>

<ol>
<li> Valenciennes,<br /></li>
<li> Binche,<br /></li>
<li> Malines,<br /></li>
<li> Point de Paris,<br /></li>
<li> Point de Lille,<br /></li>
<li> Chantilly.</li>
</ol>

<p>The varieties in Group <i>b</i> may truly be called
woven lace, because they contain a veritable tissue
in which, tho the threads are combined in
such a way as to produce more or less open
effects, the opaque parts are woven regularly,
that is as linen is woven. The pattern of the
mesh of each of these laces is different.</p>

<ul>
<li>Valenciennes (sketch q.).<br /></li>
<li>Binche (sketch r and s.).<br /></li>
<li>Malines (sketch t.).<br /></li>
<li>Point de Paris (sketch u.).<br /></li>
<li>Point de Lille (sketch v.).<br /></li>
</ul>


<p>Further, Malines, Chantilly, Point de Lille,
and Point de Paris are characterized by the presence
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourdon</i>, or heavy thread, slightly
twisted, outlining all the details of the design.</p>

<p>Grammont, or Chantilly lace, is usually made
of black silk thread. The mesh is the same as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>that of Point de Lille. In it the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toile</span> is replaced
by the grill&eacute;, which adds greatly to the lightness
of the effect.</p>

laces made with continuous thread should be considered
from the point of view of the place they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>occupy on the cushion of the worker: They are
held vertically with the selvage at the left.</p>

<p>It is necessary to mention with these laces,
Torchon, the most common of all, which has little
artistic value, and has entered more and more
into the domain of the machine. Torchon base

</div>

<p>Group <i>A.</i>&mdash;Cluny laces demand great ingenuity
in execution. The most simple are made entirely
by braiding in such a way as to produce an
effect of interlacing (sketch y.). The braids are
formed of four threads; when the interlacing is
more important they become more complicated. At
times the braids group themselves to form the flat
surface or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toile</span> which later will resolve again into
braids. They unite and part, sometimes dividing
into strands (brides) of two threads according to
the lines of the design. This design should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a><br /><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>absolutely precise. And since in it the future
employment of each thread must be constantly
foreseen, it is quite impossible to compose a
Cluny lace pattern without a knowledge of the
technique of that lace (sketch y).</p>

thread which have not a mesh base.</p>

<p>An absorbingly interesting narrative of

desolate by war.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Introduction by HERBERT C. HOOVER,</p>

<p><i>Chairman, Commission for Relief in Belgium</i></p>

<p class="p90">To quote from Mr. Hoover’s own foreword: “The
soul of Belgium received a grievous wound, but the
women of Belgium are staunching the flow, sustaining
and leading this stricken nation to greater strength and
greater life. We of the Relief have been proud of
the privilege to place the tools in the hands of these
women and have watched their skilful use and their
improvement in method with hourly admiration....
Mrs. Kellogg has done more than record in simple terms
passing impressions of the varied facts of the work of
these women, for she spent months in loving sympathy
with them. We offer her little book as our, and Mrs.
Kellogg’s tribute in admiration of them and the inspiration
which they have contributed to this whole organization.”</p></div>

<p class="p75 center"><b>By CHARLOTTE KELLOGG</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p90">“So impressed was Mrs. Kellogg by the greatness
and value of what the Belgian women are doing to help
save the Belgian people that she has written this book,
in which each chapter describes some phase or tells
some incident of what she saw. The simplicity with
which she writes makes the wonderful story of the devotion,
the unstinted service, the utter self-abnegation
with which many thousands of Belgian women are
giving themselves completely to this work stand out
all the more grandly.”&mdash;<i>Times</i>, New York.</p>

<p class="p90">“Among the thousands of books that have been written
on the war, in this country and abroad, the pen of
a woman has given us the truest portrayal of the real
heart of a heart-broken people.”&mdash;<i>Constitution</i>, Atlanta,
Ga.</p>

<p class="p90">“The pages brim with information and with profoundest
pathos. As you read some of them you will
feel a lump in your throat.”&mdash;<i>Knickerbocker Press</i>,
Albany, N. Y.</p>

<p class="p90">“It is a book of tears, heart-throbs, and of devotion....
We do not think that anyone who reads it will
regret sending a son to redress the wrongs of humanity.”&mdash;<i>Inquirer</i>,
Philadelphia, Pa.</p>

<p class="p90">“The farther you read the more you will wish to
read, so great is the charm, so intense the interest.”&mdash;<i>Eastern
Argus</i>, Portland, Me.</p>

<p class="p90">“It is full of the kind of stuff that makes us proud
of the part played by Americans in the work of saving
Belgium from famine during the long, sad months that
Germany had its iron heel on this stricken land.”&mdash;<i>Evening
Star</i>, Poughkeepsie, N. Y.</p>

<p class="p90">“The only American woman member of that Commission
wrote the book&mdash;Mrs. Charlotte Kellogg&mdash;after
spending eight months on Belgian soil; and her strong
sympathy, her unfailing appreciation, intensify the literary
charm of its pages. Learning how these women
have labored, in their mothering of smitten millions, we
get from this book side-lights upon the effects of the
war.”&mdash;<i>Richmond Times Despatch.</i></p></div>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
